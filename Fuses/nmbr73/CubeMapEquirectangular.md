What you can do with it:
- Connect a [CubeMapLoader](CubeMapLoader.md) to it ... and you see the cube's faces projected to a 2D image



[^Ryfjallet]: The picture you see being used as in input in the screenshot is the work of Emil Persson, aka [Humus](http://www.humus.name).
[^Madsy]: The DCTL code is based on the awesome work of Madsy who was so kind to release his implementation to the public domain
