# Studies

The fuses in the `Studies` subfolder are not meant to provide any functionality or to be actually used in Fusion. It's more about having a simple example to show a single aspect without getting lost in tons of code that has all the bells and whistles. On the contrary, it is even about avoiding all the comfy inspector controls and options that would bloat the code.

If you search for a specific aspect implemented in one of these Fuses (see the readme and try th Fuse), then it is not about using the Fuse, but about reading and reusing the code for your own Fuse.
