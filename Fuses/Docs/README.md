# Docs

* [MultiButtonControl.fuse](MultiButtonControl.fuse) ... see [MultiButtonControl](https://github.com/nmbr73/Kernfusion/wiki/MultiButtonControl)
<!-- * [texture](texture.md) (wip) -->


The fuses in the `Docs` are only meant as simple examples to document single controls, functions, etc. But the documentation itself has been moved to the [project's wiki](https://github.com/nmbr73/Kernfusion/wiki).


<!-- It'll be nice to have the wiki in Pages (but as you can see e.g. on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41183642/how-to-convert-github-wiki-into-github-pages it is not an easy one).
