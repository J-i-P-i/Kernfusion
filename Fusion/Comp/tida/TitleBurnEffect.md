A comp using TiDa's [Bokeh](../../Fuses/tida/Bokeh.md) Fuse to create a title burn effect.

This is a Comp to demonstrate how easy it is to get a title burn effect (see the video below). A Fast Noise is attached to the Mask Input. It's size, detail and contrast is adjusted that a displacement looks natural. Erosion is also driven by the Mask and subsequent size (white point), black point, contrast and pivot adjustment let one control the fire detail.
