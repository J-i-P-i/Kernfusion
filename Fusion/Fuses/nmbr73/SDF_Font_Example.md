With Otavio Good's [shader_fontgen](https://github.com/otaviogood/shader_fontgen) one can create a SDF (signed distance function) based font texture. For a good introduction into SDF Fonts based on the technique proposed by [Chris Green of Valve at SIGGRAPH 2007](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf) see [SDFont](https://github.com/ShoYamanishi/SDFont), a *Signed Distance Font Generator and Runtime Utility* by [Shoichiro Yamanishi](https://github.com/ShoYamanishi)

Shadertoys using the font texture:
- [SDF font 0](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/NtG3Dd) by [IFHEo](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/IFHEo)
- [GPU and OS detector v2](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/7ssyzr) by [archee](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/archee)
- [iResolution, iMouse, iDate, etc](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/llySRh) by [FabriceNeyret2](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/FabriceNeyret2)
- [\[SH17C\] Physically Based Shading](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4sSfzK) by [knarkowicz](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/knarkowicz)

Other Shadertoys that display text:
- https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldfcDr ... uses the font texture and adds some effects
- https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XdXGRB ... just "paints" the letters - no texture needed
- https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Mt2GWD ... a pixel font - no texture needed
