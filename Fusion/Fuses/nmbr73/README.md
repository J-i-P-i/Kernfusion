# Fuses by nmbr73

Not meant to provide any 'production ready' functionality or to be even used in Fusion. It's about getting some ideas and having a basis for your own experiments. Being myself a noob when it comes to Fusion, Lua, Python and even Git, these Fuses are actually just my personal playground to persist and (hopefully) evolve some of my findings.

All of this is in a very early stage. So far I started working on ...

- **[CubeMapLoader](CubeMapLoader.md)** to load a sequence of 6 images as a single texture
- **[CubeMapUnfold](CubeMapUnfold.md)** DCTL non-sense (was just to develop and debug the shader access to a cube map texture)
- **[CubeMapColorizer](CubeMapColorizer.md)** colorize the faces of a cube by different colors (via DCTL)
- **[CubeMapEquirectangular](CubeMapEquirectangular.md)** DCTL based projection of a cubemap to a 2D image
- Garbage/**[MultiButtonControls](Garbage%20Collection/MultiButtonControl.md)** example for the different MultiButtonControl types
