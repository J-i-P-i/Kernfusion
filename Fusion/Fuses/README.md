# Fuses

Not much in here yet. Meant to collect and cleanup code experiments - for example from the [WSL Forum](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/index.php) (if permission by the respective author is granted). As a kind of 'pre-reactor' area if not mature enough for publication yet; or for Fuses just intended as code examples to learn from, or to provide code fragments to be utilized in your own solutions. But a 'centralized' repository most probably makes very little sense in this regard - however, having some examples could maybe help to shape some schema to link between different repositories?!?
