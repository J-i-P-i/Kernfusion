# Kernfusion

Tach, not much in here - until now this repo is more my own note taking place / scratch pad kind of thing ... yada yada ... whatever ... you may (or may not) want to look into ...

- [Fuses](Fuses/README.md) ... pretty empty and not working
- [Wiki](https://nmbr73.github.io/Kernfusion/) ... not a wiki and in the making

... whatever


To get started checkout the repository and then open `Wiki/` as an Obsidian.md vault.
