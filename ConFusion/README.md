Welcome to the Kernfusion wiki!

Yet nothing usable to be found here ... no, not an attempt to build up some serious documentation, but more my personal notebook / scribbling pad.

* [[Event-Functions]]
* [[AddControlPage]]
* [[MultiButtonControl]]
* [[WebGL to DCTL/README|WebGL to DCTL]]

Finding a "how to do this simple thing" all to often seems to be like searching the [VFXPedia](https://www.steakunderwater.com/VFXPedia/96.0.243.189/index4875.html?title=Main_Page) mirror, reading not only multiple articles the information is distributed on, but also the discussion pages, to then jump into some threads on the [wesuckless](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/) and [bmd](https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com) forums to finally try a google search to maybe complement the whole picture by some (excellent but ancient) blog posts.

I think there is no chance to compile, and investigate, and update all that documentation - in particular not for a single person. But as I take my notes of some things I find out anyways (at least I try to take some notes if I have to lookup something a second time), why not take them in a wiki - seems to be an okay format to complement and evolve the single articles incrementally and whenever there is a need or something I find out.
