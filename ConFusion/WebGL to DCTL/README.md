Welcome to the Shadertoys wiki!

A wiki might help to collect the information found on our journey converting GLSL shaders to DCTL. For example one could write an article on [[swizzling]], [[sign()]], or [[Mathematical Functions]] ...

Currently editable by anyone with an github account to make it as open and as easy as possible to contribute. Let's see if it works out. Otherwise we'd have to restrict contributions to be reviewed via pull requests.
