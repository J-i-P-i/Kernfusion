Complex workflows can be automated in Fusion through the use of the FuScript command line process which runs from the command prompt and allows you to execute [[Lua]] and [[Python]] code. FuScript also allows remote network socket-based app intercommunication to other copies of Resolve Studio, Fusion Studio, Fusion Render Node, Fusion Render Manager, Fusion Bin Server, and Generation that are active on your local network subnet.
