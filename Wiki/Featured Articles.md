Currently experimenting with integrating [[Kartaverse/Workflows/index|Kartaverse/Workflows]] into the Wiki. See the [[Creating Volumetric NeRFs]] as an example for the reformatting.

Another test is [[Fusion and DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/index|Fusion]]

$p(x|y) = \frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}$, \(p(x|y) = \frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}\).


This is Lua's `#!lua if x ~= 42 then -- ...` inlined in text.

And some ++cmd+opt+q++, ++ctrl+alt+del++ keystrokes,
