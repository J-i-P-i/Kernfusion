Currently experimenting with integrating [[Kartaverse/Workflows/index|Kartaverse/Workflows]] into the Wiki. See the [[Kartaverse/Workflows/Creating Volumetric NeRFs]] and [[OpenDisplayXR VDD|OpenDisplayXR/VDD]] as an example for the reformatting. Started to work on [[DEV The Ultimate Guide to OpenUSD Pipeline Development]] as another (a bit painful) example.

**Scrivener exports:**

- [ ] Immersive Pipeline Integration Guide
- [x] [[KartaVision]]
- [ ] Vonk Ultra
- [ ] Krokodove Essentials
- [x] [[Kartaverse/Workflows/index|Kartaverse Workflows]]

**WSL-Posts worth it (and allowed) to be copied:**

- [x] [Running Scripts From Fusion Expression Fields](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=43229#p43229) --> [[Running Scripts From Fusion Expression Fields]]

<!--
Another test is [[Fusion and DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/index|Fusion]]

$p(x|y) = \frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}$, \(p(x|y) = \frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}\).


This is Lua's `#!lua if x ~= 42 then -- ...` inlined in text.

And some ++cmd+opt+q++, ++ctrl+alt+del++ keystrokes,

[[Config|Config/]]
