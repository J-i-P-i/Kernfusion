A `.plugin` file is a C++ compiled shared library, similar to a .dll file. Such plugins are a way to create new Fusion 3rd party nodes (aka [[Tool|Tools]]). 

Plugins are Fusion [[Tool|Tools]] written using the [[FusionSDK]]. Note that Plugins do work only in the payed Versions of BMD's Software, so you need either Fusion Studio, or DaVinci Resolve Studio. An alternative to native Fusion Plugins are [[OpenFX]] Plugins and [[Fuse]].
