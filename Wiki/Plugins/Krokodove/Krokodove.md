Krokodove (KKD) is a cross-platform compatible plugin for Fusion Studio and DaVinci Resolve Studio. It includes 100+ free Fusion tools. Krokodove was created by Raf Schoenmaekers of [Komkom Doorn](http://komkomdoorn.com).

> [!warning] Compatibility
> Please note that KKD is a compiled Fusion plugin that was created with the FusionSDK. The KKD tools will not work in Fusion Standalone (free) or Resolve (free). A paid copy of either Fusion Studio or DaVinci Resolve Studio is required to run this plugin.

The KKD shape tools allow you to create animatable vector artwork which is excellent for node-based motion graphics projects. See the [Krokodove Showcase Vimeo Videos](https://vimeo.com/channels/krokodove) to get an idea of what's possible with Krokodove.

The KKD data tools support workflows similar to [Houdini CHOPS](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/chop/index.html) (short for "Channel Operators"; see also [HoudiniChops](https://www.tokeru.com/cgwiki/index.php?title=HoudiniChops) in the [cgwiki](https://www.tokeru.com/cgwiki/index.php?title=Main_Page)) through the processing of lists, and sets of arrays.

## Installation

The Krokodove plugin can be installed using the [Reactor Package Manager](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=3067) for Resolve Studio/Fusion Studio.

Once the installation is complete, restart Resolve Studio or Fusion Studio standalone. This will load the KKD plugin.

## Accessing the KKD Nodes

Once Fusion Studio has finished loading you will have access to a new "Tools \> Krokodove" set of menu items.

You can also right-click in the Nodes view area, and select the "Add Tool \> Krokodove" contextual menu item to access the KKD tools.

## Where to go from here ...

First you may want to look into the [[Example Compositions]] available via Reactor. Then you can get an overview by scanning the [[Node Categories]], the [[Node Reference Guide]], and the [[Modifier Reference Guide]]. Finally the [[Node Cookbook]] is here to help with practical examples (once it has been written ðŸ˜œ ).
