To access the installed KKD example comps, navigate to the "Reactor \> Tools \> Show Comps Folder" menu item in Fusion Studio.

This will open up a folder browsing window using Explorer (Windows) or Finder (macOS).

The folder window displays the contents of the PathMap based location of "Reactor:/Deploy/Comps/".

Double-click on the folder labeled "Krokodove" to open it.

Inside this location you will have access to 35 example comps that use a variety of KKD tools. These examples are stored in categorized sub-folders for quick access.
