# Kartaverse Learning Resources

The bottom left section of the Scrivener file also has a Resources section with scripts, images, zip files, etc to act as an offline portable base toolkit people can bring with themselves on a USB thumbstick.

# KartaVision is in the Docs

Also, there is a base entry in the "Welcome to the Kartaverse" guide near the top that has some neat things in it. So much lead time for licensing and R&D collaboration went into KartaVision + DejaVuAI Photon integration efforts TBH.

# An OpenDisplayXR Powered Kartaverse?!?!

If you were wondering, the OpenDisplayXR project's central purpose (to me) is to make "KartaVision" a real world version of the "[Minority Report](https://youtu.be/PJqbivkm0Ms)" computer interface UX:

# Flexible Human User Interface Device Support for Direct 3D/XR Scene Interactions

In KartaVision, I'm going with purely the 3dconnexion SpaceMouse Enterprise input device as the primary interface one uses for all UX interactions.

Technically you can have 4 SpaceMice connected to a single laptop at once, for a dual user operation mode via a cloud rendered window into the Kartaverse. The space mouse sure does make for a clean desktop console usage experience.

  

OpenDisplayXR also has the structural design to allow GamePads, HMD hand controllers, mice, as well as graphics tablets to be used as mappable inputs.

If your interests include music composition, then MIDI style keyboards, drum pads, and OSC (Open Sound Control) based data feeds from apps like TouchOSC are attractive options for triggering 3D scene graph based actions/events.

# Passive Stereo 3D Polarizer Based Multi-View Display Generators

The [Schneider Digital "3D PluraView" passive stereo 3D polarizer display](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/josef-j-schneider-41799536_3d-pluraview-stereoscopic-3d-visualisation-activity-7006663474290270208-7TUm) is the ideal "operator station" centric XR display interface for KartaVision and the larger Kartaverse suite of tools.

This setup comfortably allows 3 people with polarizer glasses to watch the same 3D view and collaborate.
