Vonk Ultra provides a wide range of "data node" fuses that allow you to create efficient node graphs in Fusion that directly work with text, numbers, CSV spreadsheets, JSON, XML, YAML, and many other types of data using modifier nodes. More information about [Vonk Ultra can be read in the documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U9WfdHlE1AZHdU6_ZQCB1I2nSa5I7TyHG2vKMi2I7v8/edit?usp=sharing).

After you have the Reactor Package Manager window open again, you have the option to select the "Kartaverse \> Vonk Ultra" category on the left sidebar.

To install Vonk Ultra, click on the package named "Vonk Ultra", and then press the "Install" button. This will automatically install each of the required Vonk sub-packages in a single step.

Once the Reactor installation process is complete, please relaunch Resolve or Fusion standalone. This will cause Fusion to scan for and then load the new fuses we just installed. Scanning for new fuses is a process only done when Fusion first starts up.
