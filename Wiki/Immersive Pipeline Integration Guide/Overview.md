The pipeline integration guide is written with the goal of helping new visual effects teams get up-and-running with a BMD (Blackmagic Design) Resolve Studio v18 & Fusion Studio v18 centric pipeline from scratch.

Since this is a workflow automation focused document, it will also cover the WSL Reactor Package Manager, the installation and use of render managers, the installation and configuration of 3rd party DCC (digital content creation) tools from the perspective of a compositor's needs, an overview of common Windows/Linux/macOS command-line utilities, bare-metal Windows/Linux operating system reloads, OpenColorIO, OpenImageIO, and more.

The end audience for this guide is primarily artists who are considering adopting "The Kartaverse" pipeline tools into their workflows.
