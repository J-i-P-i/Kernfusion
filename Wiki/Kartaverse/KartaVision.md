## Overview

1st1 Technologies, LLP, and [authorized Photon workflow solutions developer](https://dejavuai.com/announcing-andrew-hazelden-as-an-official-dejavuai-photon-developer-program-partner/https://dejavuai.com/announcing-andrew-hazelden-as-an-official-dejavuai-photon-developer-program-partner/), Andrew Hazelden of Dover Studios, Inc., are pleased to announce that "[KartaVision](https://dejavuai.com/kartavision-for-blackmagic-resolve-fusion-plugin-launches-january-2022/)", a DÃ©jÃ VuAI Photon licensed integration plugin. The KartaVision for Blackmagic Design Resolve/Fusion plugin builds a new layer of intuitive artist-friendly node-based image processing technology on top of DÃ©jÃ VuAI's best-in-class, industry-leading reverse image search algorithms.

Never before have visual effects artists, video editors, photographers, filmmakers, content creators, and game designers had this type of exciting technology wired into their DCC tools at such a low level via the power of "data nodes".

KartaVision was designed from the ground up to meet the exacting needs of the Media and Entertainment sector. Whether you are an artist working with standard film & TV media formats, 360VR immersive footage, volumetric 6DoF captured media, RGB LIDAR LASER scan point cloud datasets, multi-view lightfields, or ultra-high resolution game assets, KartaVision has your needs covered.

Fast, efficient, and customizable are the key attributes that make this new class of computer vision software a good fit for content creators of all types. KartaVision allows you to mix Photon's unrivaled power and versatility, with EXIF/IPTC metadata tag-based cascading search operators, LPeg expressions, and unified OpenCV and PyTorch image processing nodes for an unmatched set of tools that will take your media production efforts to new places.

KartaVision is optimized for distributed computing workflows. It ships with ready-to-use presets for tools like Amazon AWS Thinkbox's Deadline render manager, PIXAR's Tractor render manager, and SideFX Houdini's TOPS (Task Operators)/PilotPDG technology. The KartaVision toolset can scale seamlessly from running on a single laptop system (via Photon Personal Server licensing), to running at scale with a roomful of workstations and rack-mounted render nodes that have super-powerful GPUs and CPUs.

For even larger deployments, Photon Enterprise Server can be run in your favorite cloud or VM environment, with on-demand and burstable scaling. This is essential when you need to search through millions of high-resolution medium-format images, image sequences, and movie files on a tight deadline.

Take your workflows to the next level with the combined power of DÃ©jÃ VuAI Photon and KartaVision.

A node/based RIS (Reverse Image Search) toolset that uses data nodes in Resolve/Fusion via an HTML 5 inspired CSS (Cascading Search Sheet) technology that allows concatenation of nodal operators, search variants, LuaJIT based search scriptlets, and overloaded search operators.

With the ability to perform hybrid search using object classification operators, semantic segmentation operators, XMP/EXIF metadata operators, geographic metadata operators (including geo-fencing), and more.... You'll never walk past a CCTV camera in a public place and feel the same... ðŸ« 

After 2 years of negotiation, a specially licensed version of [DejaVuAI Photon RIS technology](https://www.rockitek.com/takepost/kartavision-for-blackmagic-resolve-fusion-plugin-launches-january-2022/) is available for order from Photon's webstore. Discount pricing for the Photon RIS engine is available to all KartaVision users. This addon gives you access to an unrivalled best-in-class RIS engine. The 3rd party Lua Module installs in mere moments and then becomes active in your next user session.
