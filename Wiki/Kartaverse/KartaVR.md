## Adding KartaVR via Reactor

In order to install KartaVR you need to have Resolve/Fusion and the [[Reactor]] Package Manager installed beforehand. To add the KartaVR packages to a new workstation, first start by launching the Reactor Package Manager window (see [[Reactor#Open Reactor Package Manager]]). 

In the Reactor window, double-click on the left side-bar category item labelled "Kartaverse" to expand this hierarchy.

Then select the "Kartaverse > KartaVR" sub-category on the left sidebar to shorten the amount of content displayed in the part of the Reactor window where atom packages are listed.

Click on the package name "KartaVR" in the main part of the Reactor window, and then press the "Install" button. 

A progress dialog is displayed that shows each of the files as they are downloaded from the Reactor GitLab repository via cURL and installed into the "Reactor:/Deploy/" PathMap location on your hard disk.

Several "Install Script Confirmation" dialogs will be displayed during the Reactor installation process. The dialog is asking for your input. 

  

You can press the "OK" button if you would like to set up several preferences automatically during the install of the Reactor "Bin" category content like the FFmpeg utility. Alternatively, you can press the "Cancel Installation" button and that specific "Install Script" item will be skipped.

After the "KartaVR" content has been fully installed, we then need to click on the package name "KartaVR 3rd Party Libraries" to install it as well. This Reactor package adds the extra open-source utilities needed to efficiently use the KartaVR automation scripts.

  

The "KartaVR 3rd Party Libraries" atom package description in the Reactor window lists all of the open-source tools you can optionally choose to install.
