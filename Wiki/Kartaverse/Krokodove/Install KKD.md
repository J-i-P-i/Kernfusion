The Krokodove plugin can be installed using the [Reactor Package Manager](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=3067) for Resolve Studio/Fusion Studio.

After you have Reactor installed and open, select the "Tools \> Plugins" category on the left sidebar. Click on the package named "Krokodove for Fusion/Resolve Studio 17" and then press the "Install" button.

Once the installation is complete, restart Resolve Studio or Fusion Studio standalone. This will load the KKD plugin.
