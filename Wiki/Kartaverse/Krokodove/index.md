Krokodove (KKD) is a cross-platform compatible plugin for Fusion Studio and DaVinci Resolve Studio. It includes 100+ free Fusion tools. Krokodove was created by Raf Schoenmaekers of [Komkom Doorn](http://komkomdoorn.com).

The KKD shape tools allow you to create animatable vector artwork which is excellent for node-based motion graphics projects.

The KKD data tools support workflows similar to [Houdini CHOPS](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/chop/index.html) (short for "Channel Operators"; see also [HoudiniChops](https://www.tokeru.com/cgwiki/index.php?title=HoudiniChops) in the [cgwiki](https://www.tokeru.com/cgwiki/index.php?title=Main_Page)) through the processing of lists, and sets of arrays.

> [!warning] Compatibility
> Please note that KKD is a compiled Fusion plugin that was created with the FusionSDK. The KKD tools will not work in Fusion Standalone (free) or Resolve (free). A paid copy of either Fusion Studio or DaVinci Resolve Studio is required to run this plugin.


## Software Required

To run Krokodove on your system you will need ...
- ![[Kartaverse/Krokodove/img/image157.png|16]] [Reactor Package Manager](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=3067) (Free), and either
- ![[Kartaverse/Krokodove/img/icon_fusion.png|22]]BMD [Fusion Studio](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/fusion/) (Paid), or
- ![[Kartaverse/Krokodove/img/icon_resolve.png|22]]BMD [Resolve Studio](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) (Paid)

## Installation

The Krokodove plugin can be installed using the [Reactor Package Manager](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=3067) for Resolve Studio/Fusion Studio.

![[Kartaverse/Krokodove/img/image373.png]]

After you have Reactor installed and open, select the "Tools --> Plugins" category on the left sidebar. Click on the package named "Krokodove for Fusion/Resolve Studio 17" and then press the "Install" button.

Once the installation is complete, restart Resolve Studio or Fusion Studio standalone. This will load the KKD plugin.

## Accessing the KKD Nodes

Once Fusion Studio has finished loading you will have access to a new "Tools \> Krokodove" set of menu items.

You can also right-click in the Nodes view area, and select the "Add Tool \> Krokodove" contextual menu item to access the KKD tools.

In Resolve Studio you can access KKD nodes using the Effects Library tab at the top left of the user interface. Expand the "Tools \> Krokodove" hierarchy to view the nodes.

## Where to go from here ...

First you may want to look into the [[Example Compositions]] available via Reactor. Then you can get an overview by scanning the [[Node Categories]], the [[Node Reference Guide]], and the [[Modifier Reference Guide]]. Finally the [[Node Cookbook]] is here to help with practical examples (once it has been written ðŸ˜œ ).
