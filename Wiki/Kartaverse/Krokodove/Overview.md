> [!wiki-todo]- Scrivener Export - Reformatting Needed!

Krokodove (KKD) is a cross-platform compatible plugin for Fusion Studio and DaVinci Resolve Studio. It includes 100+ free Fusion tools. Krokodove was created by Raf Schoenmaekers of [Komkom Doorn](http://komkomdoorn.com).

The KKD shape tools allow you to create animatable vector artwork which is excellent for node-based motion graphics projects.

The KKD data tools support workflows similar to Houdini CHOPS through the processing of lists, and sets of arrays.
