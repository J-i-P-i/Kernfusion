The Vonk Ultra toolset is installed using the [Reactor Package Manager](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=3067) for Resolve/Fusion.

After you have Reactor installed and open, select the "Kartaverse \> Vonk Ultra" category on the left sidebar. Click on the package named "Vonk Ultra" and then press the "Install" button.

Once the installation is complete, restart Resolve or Fusion standalone. This will load the fuses.
