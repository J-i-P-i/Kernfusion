About

As a technical writer and pipeline TD in the visual effects sector, I am pleased to be able to share a new workflow guide. In time, I hope the learning content might be deemed an essential read for those interested in accelerating immersive media post-production workflows using Blackmagic Design's Resolve Studio and Fusion Studio software as the central hub-like toolset.

The free guide has over 512 pages of content that covers the primary steps required to get a working content creation pipeline established from scratch for artists working at a freelancer, or small boutique studio scale of operation.

I'll be the first to admit that the document is a long read but you will be rewarded with a wide range of insights into topics you've likely not explored in-depth before. Enjoy!

Special Thanks

Special thanks go out to BMD staff including Peter Chamberlain, Steve Roberts, Kerry de Boer, Stephanie Hueter, Daniel Koch, and Peter Loveday for their assistance over the many years I've worked on Resolve/Fusion based community projects. Without their kind and thoughtful help many projects including this guide would not have been possible for me to create.
