> [!wiki-todo]- Scrivener Export - Reformatting Needed!
> This article is an export of a Scrivener document. It will definitely need at least some reformatting to work in Obsidian and MkDocs. Delete this note once the article's formatting  has been fixed to some extent.

If you want to assist the Kartaverse effort, the best way to help is to provide access to camera original "raw" unprocessed footage from a wide range of digital cinema cameras, DSLR/mirrorless cameras, flagship multi-lens mobile phones, drones, 360VR camera rigs, structured light depth sensors, lightfield cameras, and LIDAR scanners with permissive licensing. Anything you can share helps greatly.

Having new, modern, example footage to work with helps the whole Kartaverse community as it pushes forward the ongoing development of new tools, techniques and workflows.

It is important, if possible, that the sample footage is shared with permissive license terms that would allow the media to be used under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. This media usage policy allows new example project files to be created and shared broadly with the community for learning purposes.

If you have access to sample footage that you are willing to share and are the copyright holder, [please email me](mailto:andrew@andrewhazelden.com). Thanks!
