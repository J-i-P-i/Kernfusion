#### NVIDIA Omniverse

NVIDIA Omniverse

At the base level, Omniverse is a DCC platform that helps users perform tasks like next-generation OpenUSD workflow design/collaboration, virtual production asset prep, ML synthetic training data generation, and metaverse content creation.

<https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/>

The Omniverse toolset has been humorously described by end users as vaguely reminiscent of the entrepreneurial business model that existed in the Klondike era with the "pick and shovel" gear manufacturers.

The meaning here is that Omniverse is a tool that exists to serve a specific utilitarian purpose --- to help the end user get work done fast and efficiently.

The Omniverse end customer is then going off to use the pick and shovel tools they bought on large scale undertakings, to stake their gold claim, and do something big and impactful.

### Virtual Production Lens Metadata

Virtual Production Lens Metadata

A key aspect of virtual production is to have cine lenses that support the passing of lens metadata.

#### Cooke Optics

Cooke Optics

Cooke Optics cinema lenses use the /i technology lens metadata protocol to store important lens information. The /i technology lens data is passed through a PL mount lens connector to the cinema camera body.

This is a YAML based metadata encoding format that holds 4D time-based data for the lens parameters that is accurately synced to the current video frame. Also having the unique lens serial number record can be helpful in post-production as it provides artists with access to the original Cooke Optics factory lens calibration information which is useful when working with anamorphic lenses that have extensive lens breathing.

Blackmagic Design URSA 12K camera bodies for example, are able to store the /i technology metadata in native BRAW format media.
