The Kartaverse package installation approach is very flexible. Reactor makes it possible to do a minimal installation of only the KartaVR features you need. This is a good choice when getting started so you don't become overwhelmed by choice.

If you are are an entry-level 360VR content creator, who is new to using KartaVR in Resolve/Fusion, then you might choose to only install the "[Reframe360Ultra](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=36688#p36688)" and "[WarpStitchUltra](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=41337#p41337)" packages using Reactor. This is a good entry point during your first few weeks of using the toolset. These specific Reactor packages make it possible to work efficiently with fisheye, 360VR, and 180VR media.

As you become more comfortable you could slowly add more Kartaverse tools as required.

Alternatively, if you want to install every possible component in the full Kartaverse suite, it requires the dedication of several hours to set up the entire toolchain to a full production-usage level. This time estimate includes installing Resolve/Fusion/Fusion Render Node, configuring the settings in a render manager for each of the render nodes, and customizing the program execution paths for each of the 3rd party integration bindings available in the toolset.
