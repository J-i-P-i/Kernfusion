- [[Fuse|Fuses]] which are script plugins for Fusion written in the [[Lua]] scripting language,
- [[OpenFX]] plugins, which are compiled component that can be used in every graphics software bale to act as an OFX host, or
- Fusion [[Plugins]], which are written as dynamic shared objects using the [[FusionSDK]]
