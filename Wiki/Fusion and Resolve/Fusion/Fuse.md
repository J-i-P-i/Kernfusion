A ''Fuse'' is a script [[Plug-in|plug-in]] for Fusion that is written in the [[Lua]] scripting language.

Fuses are not pre-compiled plug-ins but integrate with Fusion like any other [[Tool]], and can also work in the free version of Fusion.

Here is a list of some things that fuses can do:

* Apply Color Correction Effects
* Apply Transform and Warping Effects
* Apply Blur and Glow Effects
* Draw Shapes and Patterns
* Modify Parameters on other Fusion Tools
* And More

To learn more about how to write fuses our [[Fuse Writing Manual]].

You can download some very useful Fuses from [[Reactor]] and our [[Third Party Fuses]] page.
