In the Resolve Fusion page you have several ways to access the newly installed Vonk nodes:

Select Tools Dialog

Pressing the Shift + Space hotkey will display the "Select Tools" dialog. You can also type in a partial name match like "Text" or "Number" if you know the type of Vonk node you require in advance.

It is helpful to know that the Vonk nodes all start with the letter "v" as a prefix. This helps cluster the nodes together alphabetically.

Nodes View Contextual Menu

The Vonk nodes can be browsed in a hierarchical fashion using the Nodes view. Right-click to display a contextual pop-up menu system. At the top of this menu is the "Add Tools \>" entry. Navigate to the "Kartaverse \> Vonk Ultra" sub-menus.
