Finding a "how to do this simple thing" all to often seems to be like searching the [VFXPedia](https://www.steakunderwater.com/VFXPedia/96.0.243.189/index4875.html?title=Main_Page) mirror, reading not only multiple articles the information is distributed on, but also the discussion pages, to then jump into some threads on the [wesuckless](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/) and [bmd](https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com) forums to finally try a google search to maybe complement the whole picture by some (excellent but ancient) blog posts.

In the long run a MediaWiki like it was initiated by LearnNowFX would be a great solution. But collecting stuff from different sources and taking my own notes, for me personally it's currently easier to do this locally (in particular as long as its not dozens of people working on it). If this turns out to become something useful someday, then it should be not too much of an effort to import it into a Wiki.

# Welcome to the Kernfusion (yet not a) Wiki!

Yet nothing usable to be found here ... still nothing more than my personal notebook / scribbling pad. ...
