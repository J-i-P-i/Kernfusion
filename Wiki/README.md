The following text is nonsense I guess - a good opportunity for someone who has a clue about the subject and can write in English: please go ahead and replace it!


# Motivation

Finding a "how to do this simple thing" all to often seems to be like searching the [VFXPedia](https://www.steakunderwater.com/VFXPedia/96.0.243.189/index4875.html?title=Main_Page) mirror, reading not only multiple articles the information is distributed across, but also the discussion pages, to then jump into some threads on the [wesuckless](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/) and [bmd](https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com) forums to finally try a google search to maybe complement the whole picture by some (excellent but sometimes ancient) blog posts.

As done with VFxPedia, suggested by nmbr73, picked up by LearnNowFX, and supported by Andrew Hazelden: A MediaWiki is probably best suited to maintain such information and to make it some ever evolving and living documentation. We truly are a long way from that, but you have to start somewhere.


# Vision

Simply put, the idea is to build a *Wiki of ConFusion* to become *the next gen VFxPedia*; to revive the approach of building up a community driven knowledge base around VFx in general and the BMD tooling in particular. And yes, I know that this is impossible, totally ridiculous and absolutely insane, but ... I have no clue - I'm a beginner enough that I just don't care.

# Approach

Most probably some 'critical mass' in terms of useful content is needed to attract people to use the information and to be willing to put own efforts in updating and complementing it.

Therefore the attempt is to first collect some existing documentation and rearrange it to be used as a foundation for a future Wiki.


# Tools

The [Kernfusion](https://github.com/nmbr73/Kernfusion) repository is here to compile, sort, structure and reformat content from different sources. Besides some tooling and experiments, the [Wiki/](https://github.com/nmbr73/Kernfusion/tree/main/Wiki) folder is the place where things mainly happen.

This folder is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault, which - for the time being - seems to be well suited for the purpose: Obsidian is free and easy to use note taking app, and behind the scenes it is file based with all content in MarkDown format. MarkDown files, in turn, can be easily managed, read, converted and allow for collaborating and versioning via Git. Currently MkDocs is used to provide a *user friendly* output of the content on GitHub Pages. If - and only if - the repository's content evolves to something useful that's worth it to open up for editing by a broader community, it should be considered to abandon it - that is after exporting the repo's content some day as a basis for the to-be MediaWiki instance. But until then and unless this thing flies, a Git repo should perfectly do to get organized.


# Getting started

If you only want to use the documentation, then (for the time being) you can just access its latest version on [confusion.nmbr73.net](http://confusion.nmbr73.net/). But this documentation won't be all too useful unless there are people who volunteer to complement and update it. Find here what's needed to get involved ...

Tools you should have in your belt are at least Git, GitHub, and Obsidian for editing the documentation; you may want to install Python, VSCode, and maybe Lua if you are interested in working on the scripts.

> [!example]- Tool installation on macOS
>
> For macOS it's recommended to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to manage the installation of third party tools.
> You may want to use one or the other of the following commands ...
>
> ```sh
> # install homebrew
> /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
>
> # install git and github cli
> brew install git
> brew install gh
>
> # install obsidian and/or vscode editors
> brew install --cask obsidian
> brew install --cask visual-studio-code
>
> # install python and (maybe) lua for scripting
> brew install python@3.10
> brew install lua
> ```

First clone the Kernfusion repository by doing a `gh repo clone nmbr73/Kernfusion` (or alternatively by a  `git clone https://github.com/nmbr73/Kernfusion`).

Download Obsidian from [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) (or install via [`brew install --cask obsidian`](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/obsidian#default) if you are on a Mac). Obsidian is used to edit files in the `Wiki/` subfolder. To do so just open this folder in Obsidian as a vault (select "Open folder as vault" and then chose the 'Kernfusion/Wiki/' subdirectory).

You should then see the exact documentation you are currently reading in Obsidian:

# Authoring

## Write with DaVinci Resolve / Fusion in mind

Topics of the articles should be all around visual effect tools in general and the BMD products in particular. It's worth to mention Blender, Houdini, After Effects, and whatever the market has to offer in this area - but they are well covered by other communities, and therefore focus here is on DaVinci Resolve and Fusion and how such tools integrate with these in a workflow for visual artists.

## Write with an audience in mind

Target audience of the articles is (maybe) ...

- users / vfx artists, using the different tools
- administrators / operators / engineers / pipeline TDs, provisioning and maintaining a vfx toolchain
- developers, writing tools, coding scripts, implementing drivers and programming visual effects

... with a focus on the latter two (in general very good and extensive manuals exist for the end-users of the tools) and blurred borders between the three.

Please organize / structure your articles with the different audiences in mind; complete articles dedicated to a specific audiences may be tagged as such ... maybe by `#artist`, `#admin`, `#automation`, `#scripting`, `#dev`, or the like? But I can't (and don't want to) set the rules how to do this: I think (hope) that it will just happen with some good examples that others copy and evolve.

## Write with a Wiki in mind

Depending on the source, we will have some material structured like a book - and people tend to build documentation this way. But whenever you ask yourself "how can I bring the files in the Obsidian folder into the right order", or "the order of the articles on the lefthand side of MkDocs output is not correct", you are probably on the wrong track! A Wiki is a "network" of articles and not designed to be read from a beginning to an end.

...

# Potential Sources

There's a lot of material we could start with and which is available. But ==it must be checked what of it may be used under which conditions!== Then each option needs to be examined, if and how an initial import can be done - but most of it will probably require some scripting and/or lots of manual effort. Anyways, feel free to extend this list with interesting sources you know of:

- Andrew Hazelden has written hundreds of pages of documentation that he shared with the community
- Roger Magnusson's Fusion Class Browser could deliver lots of API definitions
- rne1223 has structured a lot of information for his [fuse-snippets](https://github.com/rne1223/fuse-snippets)
- [VFxPedia](https://www.steakunderwater.com/VFXPedia/96.0.243.189/index4875.html?title=Main_Page) contains a lot of (still valid) information that could serve as a basis
- There are many threads in the WSL forum that are written and structured in the format of an article or  documentation
- The BMD ASCII files in the developers examples could be a good start to extend and experiment

In the [[Lab]] I'm currently investigating how to import such sources into Obsidian and how to make the vault well prepared for MkDocs.
