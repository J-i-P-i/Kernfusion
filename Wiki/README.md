Files within this directory are (currently) meant to be used as an Obsidian vault, that (for the time beeing) gets published via MkDocs.
Therefore all the Markdown files you find in here are **not** in GitHub flavor!
This `README.md` file is only here to get displayed on GitHub when opening the Wiki/ folder and is not part of the MkDoc output.
