> [!TODO] Information for Developers
> The [[Reactor]] article (and in the future maybe others) is addressing the normal Reactor user. This section is meant to provide some background information for people who want to tweak the installation or want to get into Reactor development.

## Installation folder

You can set a diferent path during installation. You can change the installed Reactor location later on by modifying the Fusion "PathMap" preferences and pointing the "Reactor:" PathMap at a new folder path.

The standard / default installation folders are:

On Apple macOS:
- DaVinci Resolve
    `/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Reactor/`
- Fusion
    `/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/Fusion/Reactor/`

On Microsoft Windows:
- DaVinci Resolve
    `C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Reactor\`
- Fusion
    `C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\Fusion\Reactor\`

On Linux:
- DaVinci Resolve
    `/var/BlackmagicDesign/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Reactor/Deploy/`
- Fusion
    `/var/BlackmagicDesign/Fusion/Reactor/`
