This [[Fuse]] visualizes a 16bit PCM WAV file. The WAV file must not exceed 50 MB. The data can be zoomed and moved.

The play point is set in the middle of the picture. Based on the fuse modifier SuckLessAudioModifier by Pieter Van Houte.

## Parameters

### Waveformparameter

There are three parameters for setting the waveform's timing: 1) Proxy 2) Zoom 3) Resolution

1.  Proxy: This multiplies the sample pool without increasing the number of pixels shown
2.  Zoom: This also multiplies the sample pool, but all values â€‹â€‹are also displayed (as far as can be displayed)
3.  Resolution: Acts as a divisor for the displayable pixels -> Resolution = 2 with HD -> 1920/2

You can choose left, right and stereo channel. The stereo signal (Both) is generated by maximum formation of the two channels.

After loading the data from file, arrays will be filled with nummerical data. The size of the audio file is limited to 50 MB in order not to make the arrays too large.

The audio data can be moved forward or backward by up to 50 frames. A crosshair can be shown and two different envelopes can be selected.

### Amplitude Spectrum:

An amplitude spectrum of the loaded WAV file can be displayed instead of the waveform (control page spectrum) Attention: The correct settings for the waveform should then be set to 1 for proxy, zoom and resolution. Only then will the FFT display the mathematically correct spectrum. However, interesting effects can also be achieved with this parameters. 

The FFT window is configurable. There are 4 different types of display: raw, bars, smooth and needles. The support points can be set equidistant. Then sections can be combined, which are also shown in the 4 forms. The color of the spectrum can be set via the color control page.

If you have selected the display of the spectrum, the "Elongation" functionality can be activated. A window above the spectrum can be selected here with offset and width. The selected data are calculated with the "Operator" parameter to be set and visualized as a bar. This value "Elongation" can be used by other nodes by "Connect to".

### Steady Waveform:

With the "Steady Waveform" functionality, you can determine how much audio data a so-called seed frame is formed from by selecting the number of frames. The seed frames are output directly, the "missing" are calculated.


### Filter:

The Samplingdata can be filtered by three frequency bands: Lowpass 0-300 Hz, Bandpass 300 Hz - 3kHz and Highpass 3kHz-20kHz.


### Elongation with Schmitt-Trigger:

Elongation can be mapped to On/Off-Values with Hystersis.

Elongation for Spectrum has now three Elongations. Each can set to separate Frequencyband with Bandwidth, Offset and Amplify
