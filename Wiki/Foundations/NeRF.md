## novel SOTA in Ultra High Resolution NeRF

SOTA?

4K resolution interactive NeRF rendering support is now possible via work by Alibaba's research team:

## Novel-view synthesis

View synthesis takes a pictures (or a number of pictures) of a subject and aims to create new views, or so to say novel views, of that subject. 3D reconstruction, the creation of three-dimensional models from a set of images, is a view synthesis that tries to reverse the process of obtaining 2D images from 3D scenes. The task of generating new images that render a subject from a different viewpoint than the one given is called a novel view synthesis.
