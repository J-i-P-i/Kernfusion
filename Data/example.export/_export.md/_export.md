Welcome to the Kartaverse
Contributed by Andrew Hazelden
About
As a technical writer and pipeline TD in the visual effects sector, I am pleased to be able to share a new workflow guide. In time, I hope the learning content might be deemed an essential read for those interested in accelerating immersive media post-production workflows using Blackmagic Design's Resolve Studio and Fusion Studio software as the central hub-like toolset.

The free guide has over 512 pages of content that covers the primary steps required to get a working content creation pipeline established from scratch for artists working at a freelancer, or small boutique studio scale of operation. 

I'll be the first to admit that the document is a long read but you will be rewarded with a wide range of insights into topics you've likely not explored in-depth before. Enjoy!

Special Thanks
Special thanks go out to BMD staff including Peter Chamberlain, Steve Roberts, Kerry de Boer, Stephanie Hueter, Daniel Koch, and Peter Loveday for their assistance over the many years I've worked on Resolve/Fusion based community projects. Without their kind and thoughtful help many projects including this guide would not have been possible for me to create.

Overview
The pipeline integration guide is written with the goal of helping new visual effects teams get up-and-running with a BMD (Blackmagic Design) Resolve Studio v18 & Fusion Studio v18 centric pipeline from scratch.

Since this is a workflow automation focused document, it will also cover the WSL Reactor Package Manager, the installation and use of render managers, the installation and configuration of 3rd party DCC (digital content creation) tools from the perspective of a compositor's needs, an overview of common Windows/Linux/macOS command-line utilities, bare-metal Windows/Linux operating system reloads, OpenColorIO, OpenImageIO, and more.

The end audience for this guide is primarily artists who are considering adopting "The Kartaverse" pipeline tools into their workflows.

If you would like technical assistance with the Kartaverse, check out the project's new Kartaverse Google Group.

Install Reactor Package Manager
If you already use Blackmagic Design's Resolve, Resolve Studio, or Fusion Studio software then the singular most important tool you can choose to install is likely the free Reactor Package Manager.

The Fusion community developed the Reactor software as a group effort to create a single-stop resource that hosts the largest collection of curated content for extending the capabilities of Resolve/Fusion. Reactor also includes a lot of content that was previously available only on the VFXPedia resource.

![][image316]

So far the Reactor Package Manager has been installed over 190,000 times since 2018! Wow. ðŸŽ‰

![][image90]

To start using Reactor, first you need to download the Reactor-Installer.lua script to your computer. 

![][image261]

Start up a new Resolve (Free), Resolve Studio, or Fusion Studio session. Open the Console window. Then simply drag the installer script from your desktop into the Fusion Console tab to run it. 

Note: If you are in the Fusion page or using Fusion Studio you can press the "Shift + 0" shortcut to display the Console window.

If for some reason the drag-and-drop approach to launching the Reactor installer fails to work... Alternatively, you can also copy/paste the text contents of the script into the Console text entry area. 

![][image267]

In the DaVinci Resolve Fusion page and in Fusion Studio you can also drag the script from your desktop into the Nodes view to run it.

When the Reactor Installer starts you are presented with the following dialog. If you want to go with the default settings you simply have to press the "Install and Launch" button.

![][image384]
Custom Install Path Button
When installing Reactor you also have the option to choose a "Custom Install Path". This button allows you to select a custom location you would like to have the Reactor content installed to. This could be a location like your user account's home folder, or another hard drive on your system, or a mapped network drive mount point for shared usage of Reactor content. 

You can change the installed Reactor location later on by modifying the Fusion "PathMap" preferences and pointing the "Reactor:" PathMap at a new folder path.
Reactor Installation Status
Reactor shows a progress bar while the installation process is underway.

![][image357]

When the Reactor installation is complete an Explorer (Win), Finder (macOS), or Nautilus (Linux) folder browsing window is displayed. This shows you the location on-disk where new Reactor content is downloaded to. This folder in Fusion terms is called the "Reactor:" PathMap location.

Essential Reactor Atom Packages
There are currently (as of 2022-11-08) a total of 356 atom packages in the Reactor Package Manager. This means there is likely something interesting for just about any type of Resolve/Fusion user's tastes.

If you are regularly creating visual effects in Fusion Studio then the following Reactor atom packages are likely something you would deem essential to maintain your productivity and sanity:

* Attribute Spreadsheet (Batch node editing)
* Append (Modify clip timings in a node-based fashion)
* AudioWaveform (Visualize .wav audio files)
* Batch Change Parameters (Batch node editing)
* ClassBrowser (Undocumented Scripting API browser)
* Cryptomatte
* DeleteFileRequesterHistory (Speed up file dialog load time by pruning the recent files list)
* Eyeon Legacy (Archive Composition Script)
* Glitch Tools (Create intentional defects / video artifacts in your footage)
* hos_SplitEXR_Ultra (Helps split apart multi-channel EXR footage)
* KAK (A powerful node-based keyer)

* stx_tools (Custom macros including an optical flow based warp tracker)
* STMapper (An amazing UV Pass/ST Map warping DCTL Fuse. It's SO FAST!!!)
* Shadertoys (A wild visual trip with DCTL ports of popular ShaderToy fragment shaders)
* TimeMachine (Retime nodes)
* Tintensity (Color Correction)
* UI Manager Lua & Python Examples (Code examples for creating custom Qt based GUIs in scripts)
* LifeSaver (Multi-Part EXR writer with filename token support)
* ParallelIO pioSaver (Multi-Channel EXR writer with filename token support)

Adding KartaVR via Reactor
In order to install KartaVR you need to have Resolve/Fusion and the Reactor Package Manager installed beforehand. To add the KartaVR packages to a new workstation, first start by launching the Reactor Package Manager window. 

In Fusion Studio you can do this by opening the root-level "Reactor" menu, then select the "Open Reactor" menu item.

![][image172]

In Resolve Studio you can do this by opening the root-level "Workspaces" menu, then navigating to the "Scripts > Comp > Reactor > Open Reactor..." menu item.

![][image371]

When the Reactor Package Manager window loads initially you will see a list of all the atom packages that are able to be installed using this user interface. 

Note: The content that is listed in the Reactor window comes from the Reactor GitLab repository. If you have an outgoing firewall, or your country/company/ISP (internet service provider) has network filtering rules that block access to GitLab you will have to use another approach to install the Reactor content on your system.

In the Reactor window, double-click on the left side-bar category item labelled "Kartaverse" to expand this hierarchy.

![][image18]

Then select the "Kartaverse > KartaVR" sub-category on the left sidebar to shorten the amount of content displayed in the part of the Reactor window where atom packages are listed.

![][image311]

Click on the package name "KartaVR" in the main part of the Reactor window, and then press the "Install" button. 

A progress dialog is displayed that shows each of the files as they are downloaded from the Reactor GitLab repository via cURL and installed into the "Reactor:/Deploy/" PathMap location on your hard disk.

![][image41]

Several "Install Script Confirmation" dialogs will be displayed during the Reactor installation process. The dialog is asking for your input. 

You can press the "OK" button if you would like to set up several preferences automatically during the install of the Reactor "Bin" category content like the FFmpeg utility. Alternatively, you can press the "Cancel Installation" button and that specific "Install Script" item will be skipped.

![][image75]

After the "KartaVR" content has been fully installed, we then need to click on the package name "KartaVR 3rd Party Libraries" to install it as well. This Reactor package adds the extra open-source utilities needed to efficiently use the KartaVR automation scripts.

The "KartaVR 3rd Party Libraries" atom package description in the Reactor window lists all of the open-source tools you can optionally choose to install.

![][image148]

Adding Vonk Ultra via Reactor
Vonk Ultra provides a wide range of "data node" fuses that allow you to create efficient node graphs in Fusion that directly work with text, numbers, CSV spreadsheets, JSON, XML, YAML, and many other types of data using modifier nodes. More information about Vonk Ultra can be read in the documentation.

After you have the Reactor Package Manager window open again, you have the option to select the "Kartaverse > Vonk Ultra" category on the left sidebar. 

To install Vonk Ultra, click on the package named "Vonk Ultra", and then press the "Install" button. This will automatically install each of the required Vonk sub-packages in a single step.

![][image121]

Once the Reactor installation process is complete, please relaunch Resolve or Fusion standalone. This will cause Fusion to scan for and then load the new fuses we just installed. Scanning for new fuses is a process only done when Fusion first starts up.

The Kartaverse Packages
Kartaverse is an extensive open-source media production pipeline that integrates seamlessly with a broad range of post-production tools used in VFX, VP, XR, 360VR, fulldome, volumetric video, computer vision, and machine learning workflows.

The core technologies that are part of the Kartaverse v5 suite are namely:

* KartaVR
* KartaVP
* KartaVision
* KartaSonic
* KartaLink
* CompX
* Vonk Ultra

These modules are based upon the culmination of many years of research & development.

Kartaverse is delivered via the web as free open-source software. It costs you nothing to download and use the Kartaverse tools for both personal and commercial usage. It even works fine with Resolve (Free) running as the host program. The main tool, KartaVR, is Apache 2.0 licensed. Several tools like Vonk Ultra are GPL v3 licensed.

Kartaverse Project Assistance
If you want to assist the Kartaverse effort, the best way to help is to provide access to camera original "raw" unprocessed footage from a wide range of digital cinema cameras, DSLR/mirrorless cameras, flagship multi-lens mobile phones, drones, 360VR camera rigs, structured light depth sensors, lightfield cameras, and LIDAR scanners with permissive licensing. Anything you can share helps greatly.

Having new, modern, example footage to work with helps the whole Kartaverse community as it pushes forward the ongoing development of new tools, techniques and workflows. 

It is important, if possible, that the sample footage is shared with permissive license terms that would allow the media to be used under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license. This media usage policy allows new example project files to be created and shared broadly with the community for learning purposes. 

If you have access to sample footage that you are willing to share and are the copyright holder, please email me. Thanks!
![][image376]

The Karta Development Journey
Many of the workflow ideas and features found in the Kartaverse suite started development in the following toolsets that I had the opportunity to collaborate on as either a developer, co-developer, software maintainer, or technical writer.

Domemaster Photoshop Actions Pack, Domemaster3D, Domemaster Fusion Macros, RocketComp, PlayblastVR, Lightfielder Suite, OBQ Shaders, CompX, dome2rect, Panoramic Geometry Collection, CameraSnap, Z360 6DOF Stereo VR Tools, Dover Planar Grid Array Camera, KartaVR Volumetric Capture Utility, HDR Pano Camera Rig PIC32 Microcontroller Firmware, IRIXBASIC, Mission Control, WarpStitch TD, Spicy Acorn Vonk, Cryptomatte, KickAss ShaderZ, SilhouetteFX Python Scripts, along with the Steakunderwater Reactor Package Manager, the Dover Studios, Inc. in-house pipeline tools BucketTime/Popcorn, the CameraCommander volumetric video pipeline, the ongoing Kino TR2X virtual production project, and the Borikuaverse project.

Choosing Your Installation Packages
The Kartaverse package installation approach is very flexible. Reactor makes it possible to do a minimal installation of only the KartaVR features you need. This is a good choice when getting started so you don't become overwhelmed by choice.
![][image143]
If you are are an entry-level 360VR content creator, who is new to using KartaVR in Resolve/Fusion, then you might choose to only install the "Reframe360Ultra" and "WarpStitchUltra" packages using Reactor. This is a good entry point during your first few weeks of using the toolset. These specific Reactor packages make it possible to work efficiently with fisheye, 360VR, and 180VR media.

As you become more comfortable you could slowly add more Kartaverse tools as required.

Alternatively, if you want to install every possible component in the full Kartaverse suite, it requires the dedication of several hours to set up the entire toolchain to a full production-usage level. This time estimate includes installing Resolve/Fusion/Fusion Render Node, configuring the settings in a render manager for each of the render nodes, and customizing the program execution paths for each of the 3rd party integration bindings available in the toolset.

Fusion Render Node Customization
It is important to customize the Fusion Render node program's PathMap settings if you would like your render farm  to be able to access the same Reactor content that you have installed in Resolve/Fusion on your laptop/desktop/workstation. This is especially true after fuses are installed using the Reactor Package Manager. 

If you rely on fuses, OFX plugins, or FusionSDK C++ compiled plugins, you need to pre-install the 3rd party addons on each render node in your render farm. If you send a Fusion composite to a render farm node that lacks a required plugin it will generate an error during the batch rendering process.

Something that can help reduce the pain of setting up and syncing Reactor content across a render farm is sharing the exact same Reactor content across a mapped SMB drive mount, or on a NFS shared mount point.

An extra step that can often be overlooked is the requirement to configure a custom "LuaModules:" PathMap entry in the Fusion Render Node app preferences to avoid Fusion Render Manager errors when batch rendering comps that use fuses like the Vonk data nodes or Cryptomatte.

Note: The example below shows the PathMaps used for locally installed Reactor content that was added to a Reactor default "AllData:" folder based install. 

You can point the "Reactor:" PathMap at any folder path you need to as long as it is not a UNC path, and it doesn't have high-ASCII or Unicode multi-byte extended characters in the filepath. 

Make sure to have a trailing slash on the final absolute filepath used to define the PathMap entry for your version of the "From: Reactor:'' and "To: /Volumes/Some/Random/Pipeline/Folder/Path/Reactor/" install location.

Configuring Fusion Render Node PathMaps

1. Open the Fusion Render Node program and select the "Preferences..." menu item.

![][image49]

2. Click on the "Global Settings > Path Map" category on the left side of the Preferences window.

![][image269]

3. At the bottom of the window click on the "New" button to add a new entry to the "User" section of the "Path Map" view.

4. Enter the following settings From: LuaModules: and To: UserPaths:Modules/Lua. Click the "Save" button to retain these settings.

5. If you don't have Reactor Path Map entries added to Fusion Render Node already, then you might have to further customize the preferences to add values like:

Windows:

From: Reactor: and To: C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\Fusion\Reactor\

macOS:

From: Reactor: and To: /Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/Fusion/Reactor/

Linux:

From: Reactor: and To: /var/BlackmagicDesign/Fusion/Reactor/

Also you would need to edit the pre-existing UserPaths PathMap entry:

From: UserPaths: and To: UserData:;AllData:;Fusion:;Reactor:Deploy

6. Restart Fusion Render Manager to lock in these values.

Note: If the LuaModules PathMap entries were not added to Fusion Render Node's preferences, a typical error message in Fusion Render Node would look a bit like this:

14/Apr/22 16:12:50: .../Fusion/Fuses/Vonk Ultra/Text/Create/vTextFromArray.fuse:5: module 'vjsonutils' not found:
no field package.preload['vjsonutils']
no file 'LuaModules:vjsonutils.lua'
no file 'LuaModules:vjsonutils/init.lua'
no file 'LuaModules:vjsonutils.so'

Automated Reactor PathMaps in Resolve Studio and Fusion Studio
If you need to install Reactor on an entire render farm, the following guide explains how to configure the preferences using command-prompt based shell scripting:

Installing the BMD Resolve / Fusion Software
Blackmagic Design's Resolve software is a powerful editing and color correction environment. Resolve is a mainstay at many high-end post-production facilities in the film & TV sector.

Blackmagic Design's Fusion Studio software is a node-based compositing environment that allows for the creation of high-quality visual effects shots. Fusion provides artists with a very capable 2.5D compositing environment, and supports the design of complex animated 2D/3D motion graphics with a high level of node-based proceduralism. Fusion also enables 360VR content creation, and more.

Download Resolve/Fusion Studio from BMD's Website
If you want to install the absolutely latest release of Resolve or Fusion you should go directly to the BMD Support Center Website to access the installers: 
https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/support/family/davinci-resolve-and-fusion

![][image285]

Alternatively, the Steak Underwater Fusion community forum has a concise list of all BMD Resolve and Fusion releases with download links.

Resolve (Free)
If you are looking for "Resolve (free)" it is listed in the BMD support center as simply "Resolve". Resolve (Free)'s software license terms allow for both personal and commercial use of the software at no cost.

About Resolve and the Fusion Page
Blackmagic Design provides access to a version of the Fusion compositing environment as a custom page in the Resolve software called the "Fusion" page.

![][image228]

The Fusion page environment allows video editors to create their own title templates in Fusion and use them on the Edit page. The Fusion page node-based environment makes it a quick job to perform basic visual effects compositing tasks inside a larger Resolve project. 

The Fusion page availability in Resolve (Free) led to the retirement of the earlier Fusion (Free) Standalone product at Fusion v9. If you want access to a standalone version of Fusion that is only found in the Fusion Studio product.

The Fusion page adds a new analogy of a "MediaIn" and "MediaOut" node which interfaces with the Media Pool/Edit/Delivery pages, in addition to the traditional "Loader" and "Saver" nodes used in Fusion for working with image sequences like OpenEXR format media.

The primary limitation of the free version of Resolve is that it can export footage at up to 3840x2160px resolution. This resolution limit is enforced as a maximum of 3840 px on the horizontal axis, and a maximum of 2160px on the vertical axis. A variety of advanced features like optical flow support, HMD previewing, and several other Fusion nodes are held back until you upgrade to Resolve Studio or Fusion Studio. 

All in all, most people can get quite far in their everyday workflows in Resolve (Free). 

If you are a freelancer doing multi-pass compositing with 4K UHD resolution EXR footage you can be very productive using merely the Resolve (Free) Fusion page environment. This is an optimal configuration to use while you are quickly mastering new skills and learning what is possible with the toolset.

Resolve Studio (Paid)
![][image287-1]

The paid version of Resolve is known as "Resolve Studio". 

There is a separate installer for Resolve Studio that is available on the BMD Support Center website. This is a separate download from the previous free version of Resolve that you might already have installed while you were evaluating the software. The two Resolve installers place the files at the same location on your hard disk so only one of them can exist at a time.

The paid version, Resolve Studio, is activated using either: a Resolve Studio "activation card" license, or a hardware-based USB licensing dongle that holds a Resolve Studio or a Fusion Studio v7-18+ license.

Resolve Studio Improvements over the Resolve (Free) Fusion page

Resolve Studio unlocks access to higher-resolution rendering support, provides improved GPU-based hardware acceleration options, unlocks FusionSDK compiled plugin support for running tools like Krokodove, and gives access to external command-line automation via FuScript/Lua/Python. The paid version also adds machine learning features, optical flow, z-depth/disparity generator tools, 360VR headset preview support in the Fusion page, stereo 3D tools, and more.

Fusion Studio Standalone (Paid)
![][image399-1]

"Fusion Studio" is the term for the dedicated standalone version of the Fusion compositing environment. Fusion Studio v18 can be activated with a Fusion Studio v7-18+ hardware-based USB dongle license, a Resolve Studio dongle license, or with a Resolve Studio "activation card" license.

Fusion Studio Improvements over the Resolve (Free) Fusion page
Fusion Studio provides a dedicated, full-screen, standalone environment for compositing without the overhead of having all of Resolve loaded into memory at the same time. 

Fusion Studio also saves your project files into .comp format documents. The .comp file format holds plain text encoded Lua table data which is easier to manage and backup inside of a larger visual effects production pipeline.

The paid Fusion Studio product unlocks access to higher-resolution rendering support, provides improved GPU-based hardware acceleration options, unlocks FusionSDK compiled plugin support for running tools like Krokodove, and gives access to external command-line automation via FuScript/Lua/Python. The paid version also adds machine learning features, optical flow, z-depth/disparity generator tools, 360VR headset preview support in the Fusion page, stereo 3D tools, and more.

If you have Fusion Studio installed on your system you also have the ability to access and use the Fusion Render Node program which allows for a near unlimited number of render nodes to be run on the same LAN based subnet with no additional license costs from BMD. This feature can massively speed up your rendering productivity on projects that require faster turn around.

Fusion Studio Standalone has a built-in Render Manager feature that works well for freelance, and solo-artists who work primarily from a single workstation based GUI session in a home-office or small office environment. The Fusion Studio bundled Render Manager is accessed using the "File > Render Manager" menu item or the "Control + M" hotkey.

![][image262]

Fusion Render Node
The Fusion Render Node program is available if you have a Fusion Studio license active on your LAN based subnet. Fusion Render Node is provided as a separate installer bundled alongside the Fusion Studio download from the BMD Support Center website.

![][image93]


When getting started, the Fusion Render Node program is typically controlled from inside a Fusion Studio based artist session using the "Fusion Render Manager". 

The Fusion render node program can also be launched directly from the command-prompt with CLI arguments, or you can control the render node software from an external render manager program of your choice.

Command Line Usage
If you launch Fusion Render Node from a Terminal/Command-Prompt window with the "-h" help flag added to the end of the line, you will see a list of the full commands that are available for your use:

"/Applications/Blackmagic Fusion 18 Render Node/Fusion Render Node.app/Contents/MacOS/Fusion Render Node" -h

Fusion Render Node [<filename.comp> | <filename.dfq>] [/quiet] [/render [/frames <frameset>] [/start <frame>] [/end <frame>] [/step <step>] [/quit]] [/listen] [/join <host>] [/log <filename>] [/cleanlog] [/verbose] [/quietlicense] [/version] [/pri high|above|normal|below|idle] [/args [...]] [/execute <script string>]

When you render a Fusion .comp file via the command prompt, the program control can be managed 100% manually under human control using the following style of shell syntax:

"/Applications/Blackmagic Fusion 18 Render Node/Fusion Render Node.app/Contents/MacOS/Fusion Render Node" "/Users/vfx/Documents/MyProject/MyProject.comp" -render -verbose -quit

If you need a quick way to grab the filepath for your .comp document in the Finder (macOS) environment, you can right-click on the file with the ALT/Option key held down on the keyboard. A contextual menu item appears with a "Copy as Pathname" menu item. This will place the full absolute file path to the document in your macOS copy/paste clipboard.

![][image236]

On Windows 10/11 you have a similar feature that lets you right-click on a file, with the shift-key held down. A contextual menu item appears with a "Copy as Path" menu item.

![][image308]

External Render Manager Usage
If you have a team of artists who rely on Fusion Render Node, as part of a larger post-production workflow, you will likely experience productivity benefits from adopting a 3rd party render manager like the Amazon AWS Thinkbox Deadline or Pixar Tractor software. 

Having an external render management tool, that was made by a 3rd party company, allows you to combine Fusion based comp rendering jobs alongside your existing 3D rendering workloads coming from a 3D department.

Using a render manager like Deadline makes it easy to control the order of operations for a group of tasks, called a "job batch", when they are computed on a render farm. This is often called a linked "dependent task". 

Having a dependent job submitted to Deadline, in a single step, reduces the amount of manual "render wrangling" a human operator has to do when supervising complex jobs running on a large farm.

The "Submit Fusion Job to Deadline" scripted tool is used to define the Fusion .comp file you would like to render, the frame range to render, how many frames should be rendered per-job task, the version of Fusion Render Node to use, and many other options.
![][image363]

Getting Started With Nodes in Fusion
If you are getting started with Fusion it can be a bit scary using nodes for the first time.

Loading Imagery
![][image50]
Imagery is imported into Fusion using Loader or MediaIn nodes.

Imagery is exported from Fusion using Saver or MediaOut nodes. 

If your Fusion timeline is set to have a single frame range (the start frame and end frame values are the same) you will be rendering a still image with your Saver node. If your Fusion timeline has a start frame and end frame range with different values, you will be exporting an image sequence.

When you are rendering imagery with a Saver node, frame padding is defined in an image sequence filename by writing in a frame number like 0000 to to match the number of zero padded digits you want in the final image:

C:\media\image_sequence.0000.exr

You can render an image to your operating system's temp folder using a Fusion feature called a "path map" which is a relative path that is used in place of the drive name:

Temp:\image_sequence.0000.exr

There is a path map option "Comp:\" that can be used to load imagery relative to the location of the current Fusion .comp compositing file. This makes it easy to move .comp projects between systems.

Comp:\image.0000.exr

Making Node Connections
Nodes are connected in Fusion by dragging a line from a red "output" box shape on one node into a triangle shaped "input" on another node.

![][image12]

If you want to connect a macro with multiple output "red" boxes like the "VerticalCross2CubicFaces" macro to your node graph, it helps if you hover your cursor over the red box shape so a tooltip will pop-up with the name of the specific output.

![][image205]

To view the current output of a node, you need to drag the node from the flow view to a viewer window. This will update the viewer window with that node's output.

If you drag a node with the shift key held down you can completely disconnect it from a node graph.

You can break the connection of a node by hovering over the starting part or ending part of a connection line. When the line end part turns light blue you can drag it away from the connection point and the node will be disconnected.

![][image245]

If you want to make a connection to a node that has multiple inputs, you can hold down the ALT/Option key on your keyboard as you drag a new connection line to the node shape. A handy popup will appear that lists each of the inputs by name.

![][image163]

The Fusion Viewer Window
You can toggle to a single viewer or a double viewer window layout using the following icon at the top of the screen:

![][image139]

This is the typical viewer window layout in Fusion where there are two viewer windows available at the top of the Fusion UI.

![][image202]
When a node is selected in the "flow" area, you can load its imagery into a specific viewer window by clicking with the left mouse button and dragging that node icon into the viewer window.

Another way to load a node's imagery into a specific viewer window is by pressing the "1" key for the left viewer window, or the "2" key for the right viewer window. To clear the imagery out of both viewer windows press the backquote "tilde" key that is located just below the escape key on most keyboards.

Color and Viewer LUTs
![][image115]
You can access individual color channels in the viewer window's toolbar with the color channel menu, or by clicking in the viewer window and pressing the hotkeys C (Shows the Color RGB Channels), R (Shows the Red Channel), G (Shows the Green Channel), B (Shows the Blue Channel), or A (Shows the Alpha Channel).

If you are working with EXR format multi-channel imagery that includes extra image channels, more entries will be displayed in the color channel menus for items like Z-Depth, Disparity X/Y, Motion Vectors, etc.
![][image161]
The LUT button allows you to change the viewer windows' preview LUT (Look Up Table) which means you can preview the effect of different color spaces on your imagery. This is useful for viewing RAW, sRGB, or Linear gamma based imagery. If your imagery looks washed out when loaded in Fusion it is typically due to a LUT setting mismatch.
![][image321]
If you need to preview imagery in a color space other than the footage's native format, I recommend you try out the OpenColorIO based LUT menu option called OCIO ColorSpace ViewLUT as it is one of the easiest to use.

When the OCIO ColorSpace LUT is active, you can select the Edit... option in the LUT menu and change the OpenColorIO source space and output space to match your footage and monitor settings. This is handy for previewing LWF linear workflow based EXRs imagery in a monitor native sRGB format.

As a tip, you can type a Color Gamma value of 2.2 into the OCIO ColorSpace LUT window to perform a "live" on the fly linear workflow gamma 1.0 to sRGB gamma 2.2 conversion that will be displayed only in the Viewer window but the linear color values in the final rendered imagery with be unaffected.

Viewer Zoom
![][image203]
If an image is too large to easily be seen in the viewer window, you can press the "FIT" icon in the viewer window to scale the imagery to the size of the viewer window. The hotkey for fitting the image to the viewer window is Control + F (Win/Linux) or Command + F (macOS).

You can adjust the image zoom level in the viewer window with the menu that is located to the left of the fit icon. To jump to the 100% zoom level you can use the Control + 1 (Win/Linux) or Command + 1 (macOS) hotkey on your keyboard.

Holding down the Control key (Win/Linux) or Command key (macOS) and scrolling the mouse wheel also allows you to zoom in/out on the imagery in the viewer window.

Viewer Transparency
![][image322]
The viewer "â€¢â€¢â€¢" kebab menu (the menu entry with three dots) has a "Checker Underlay" option that is used to toggle on/off the transparent background checkerboard pattern in the viewer. This will allow you to either have a black background shown behind your transparent alpha channel image areas or a dark grey checker pattern.

Proxy Modes
There are two proxy mode buttons in the Fusion UI. The proxy buttons are labeled "Prx" and "APrx" and are located just below the timeline, to the right of the playback controls.
When you use the left mouse button to click on the "Prx" button you can toggle the proxy mode ON or OFF.

![][image389]
When the proxy mode is enabled, the viewer windows are rendered at a reduced resolution compared to your final output setting. This makes Fusion's viewer windows more responsive and interactive which is quite noticeable when you start to adjust nodes and update the node settings on footage over 2K in resolution. 

Using proxies as you develop a new comp is a very effective way to improve the rendering speed in your Viewer windows which is an essential workflow technique when working with high resolution media or on demanding composites that are slow to render.

![][image359]
If you click on the "Prx" button with your right mouse button, a popup menu will appear that lets you adjust the level of the proxy resolution reduction that is used when the proxy mode is enabled.

Proxy level "1" will render the viewer window at full resolution. Setting the proxy level to a value higher than "1" will cause Fusion to reduce the quality of the imagery in the viewport by drastically reducing the render resolution. The proxy control has the ability to massively increase the speed that Fusion can update the imagery that is displayed in the viewer windows.

The "APrx" button is the Auto Proxy mode and it is used to provide a way to have a "draft quality" like proxy mode enabled. The APrx feature is activated the moment you start adjusting sliders and settings for a node, which allows you to have a real-time preview of the changes. When you stop adjusting the node settings, the auto proxy rendering state will deactivate and then your standard resolution / proxy settings will be used.

Adding Nodes Quickly
![][image173]
When you are working in Fusion's flow area, you can press the Shift + Space hotkey to open up the Add Tool dialog. This window provides a quick way to add new tools and macros to your scene without having to navigate through the menu system to find the right item.

As you type in the name of the tool or macro you want to add, the list is updated with matching entries. You can type in partial names and the window will search for the closest item. In this example I typed in "Alpha" in the text field at the bottom of the dialog and only the nodes and macros with alpha in part of their name are listed.

![][image44]

Resolve/Fusion Scripting
Resolve Studio's scripting API and pipeline customization support has slowly improved since Python and Lua scripting were added in Resolve v15 back in 2018. The Resolve scripting API was originally added at the same time as the Fusion page was brought into Resolve since it was derived from Fusion Studio's pre-existing FuScript bindings.

Scripting Options
Resolve Studio/Fusion Studio supports running scripts using Python 2.7 & 3.6-3.10+, as well as Lua scripting. There is a "Python Script Snippets for Fusion TDs" Steakunderwater thread that collects useful Python compatible code snippets in one convenient place.

GUI Toolkits
If you create a Resolve script using Python or Lua you have the option of using an integrated GUI creation toolkit called "UI Manager" which is based upon the QT window manager. If you require more complex GUI creation tools you can also bring along your own PySide install.

The Lua and Python scripting documentation for the Resolve API is located on-disk in the Developer folder. Additionally, there is a "Workflow Integrations" interface which adds NodeJS based scripting, too.

![][image255]

Note: The "README.txt" file in the Workflow Integrations folder also includes an aside that talks briefly about UI Manager. This readme document acts as the only official notes published by Blackmagic Design about the existence of the UI Manager GUI creation toolkit. 

In part, this sparse documentation situation is due to the fact that the Fusion 8 Scripting Guide PDF was published prior to the addition of the UI Manager library in Resolve/Fusion. 

This "README.txt" file is located on-disk at:
Windows Docs:
C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\Developer\Workflow Integrations\README.txt
macOS Docs:
/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Developer/Workflow Integrations/README.txt
Linux Docs:
Path to be validated.

Script Paths
User created Python and Lua scripts are placed on-disk in either of the two Resolve based "Scripts" folders:

C:\Users\<User Account>\AppData\Roaming\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\Fusion\Scripts\

C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Scripts\

It is also possible to configure a relative filepath system called a "PathMap'' which allows you to use a custom folder path for storing scripts, macros, and other resources. This is customized in the "Fusion > Fusion Settings..." menu. In the Fusion Settings window, look under the left sidebar entry labelled "PathMaps".

![][image61]

Fusion Class Browser Script
There is a 3rd Party Scripting API browser tool distributed in the Reactor Package Manager called the "Fusion Class Browser" that is helpful for learning more about undocumented scripting API features. 

This screenshot shows the results from examining the available Fairlight API functions using the Fusion Class Browser script.

![][image35]

UI Manager Scripting Examples
The Steakunderwater Fusion community forum's "Building GUIs With Fusion's UI Manager" scripting thread provides example Lua and Python code to get you started. 

There is a companion "UI Manager Lua & Python Examples" package in the Reactor Package Manager that simplifies the steps needed to download and install the collection of example script resources.

![][image344]

ScriptLib Files
Fusion has a .scriptlib file based-approach that can be used to run Lua code when a fresh Fusion session is started, or a new comp is created. Scriptlib files also allow the addition of new 3rd party Lua functions and global variables that are then available in all other Lua scripts you might run, and in fresh Fusion Console window sessions.

The Reactor Package Manager provides a "Resolve Essentials" atom package that improves the QoL (Quality of Life) for Resolve based scripting enthusiasts. This package also restores a missing scriptlib file that comes included with Fusion Studio but not with Resolve Studio. 

This resource is copied into the scripts PathMap-based folder location of:
Scripts:/bmd.scriptlib

Which in Reactor terms equates to:
Reactor:/Deploy/Scripts/bmd.scriptlib

Actions/Event Callbacks
Resolve's Fusion page has an action/event callback system that is implemented via .fu and .zfu files. These documents are placed in the "Config:/" PathMap folder. 

A .fu file is a configuration document that is stored in a Lua table based text file. A .zfu file is a zip archive that holds a .fu file and any extra supporting resources like companion scripts or PNG formatted icons at the base level of the zip file with no encapsulating folders.

If a user-created action needs access to an on-disk resource, there is a "$CFG/" token value that can be entered as a prefix to a Lua script's file path entry. This $CFG token represents the parent folder where the .zfu/.fu file is located on-disk:

Execute = [[target:RunScript("$CFG/SomeScript.lua", { mousex = args._sxpos, mousey = args._sypos })]],

A .fu file can be used to create new menus in Fusion Standalone, assign hotkeys to scripts and actions, and capture event hooks for many of the tasks a compositor carries out, as well as add drag-n-drop support for processing files dragged from a Desktop folder browsing window into the Nodes view.

The UI Manager example scripts include a minimal prototype of a QT-based Action/Event script listener tool called "Action Listener". This script can help you discover new and novel ways to automate your compositing workflows.

![][image80]

GPU Accelerated Effects
The Edit/Color/Fusion pages all support the use of OFX plugins. 

There is a customized version of the OFX plugin development documentation available in Resolve's Developer folder.

![][image145]

Resolve also has a DCTL (DaVinci Color Transform Language) that is used to create LUTS. More information about DCTL is available in BMD's Docs. Also check out the BaldAvenger GitHub repository for code examples.

![][image27]

The addition of the Fusion page in Resolve allowed for the inclusion of an "Effects Template" feature. These templates are installed using .setting and .drfx files which are based around Fusion macros that are packaged and used directly on clips in a video editing timeline.

This system allows for any Fusion node to be wrapped into a Group/Macro container object and exported for use in the Edit page.

![][image349]

Custom GUI controls added to an Effects Template "macro" are accessible in the Inspector view on the Edit Page.

![][image33]

You are able to refine an Edit page effect using the controls provided by the Fusion page. This is done by clicking the small magic-wand icon next to the macro's name in the Inspector window. The magic-wand icon has a small arrow pointing towards the base of the wand.

![][image232]

Switching from the Edit page into the Fusion page in this fashion provides access to Fusion's traditional Spline and Keyframe editor views. 

These animation editing controls in Fusion are more full-featured for adjusting keyframes and spline curve tangents than is possible with traditional ResolveFX/OFX Plugins that are animated on the Edit page.

![][image390]

Fusion SDK
The Fusion page also has a Fusion SDK which is a C++ API. This development kit allows the creation of 2D Effects, 3D workspace based content, Renderer3D node based plugin rendering engines, the addition of new Loader/Saver node file formats, and more to be created. 

The FusionSDK C++ files are available by request to developers at zero cost but require the signing of an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) with the BMD Developer program.

I'd suggest you try contacting BMD's support team about this topic, or if you happen to see Steve Roberts or Matt Jefferson at a BMD booth at a tradeshow event near you, make sure to ask them for more details while meeting them in-person.

Fuse SDK
The Fusion page has a Fuse API which allows DCTL (DaVinci Color Transform Language) based hardware accelerated graphics operations to be done inside a Lua scripted node that works seamlessly in a cross-platform way across Metal, OpenCL, and CUDA based GPUs. 

The Fuse API also supports LuaJIT based code to be used to do operations like render vector shapes, process image metadata, add custom image importer/exporter support, or apply effects. This Fuse API is the Fusion equivalent of Nuke Blink Scripting.

BMD released a new Fuse SDK PDF guide this year which is an excellent document for getting developers and enthusiasts comfortable with the Fuse API. The guide comes with Resolve/Fusion v18 now but it is also possible to download the guide from the BMD Software Support Center's "Latest Support Notes" category: Fusion_Fuse_SDK.pdf

![][image189]

Macros
A macro in the Fusion page is basically a grouped set of Fusion stock nodes that are collected inside a collapsible folder group. 

When a macro is created using a grouped object it can have an internal registry-based node identifier type of either a "MacroOperator" or a "GroupOperator". 

A macro is saved to disk as a plain text document that represents an ASCII-encoded Lua table structure on-disk. The macro file is saved with the file extension .setting.

When making macros to share with other users, it is important to know that a GroupOperator node can be easily re-expanded and edited later in the Nodes view. 

A MacroOperator is harder to inspect as it needs you to copy the node into a programmer's plain text editor to revise its settings by hand.

When you have a MacroOperator open in a text editor, you can find & replace the word "MacroOperator" with "GroupOperator". This will allow you to visually expand that node's group in the Nodes view.

When creating macros, expressions can be added, along with intool scripts, and custom UserControl based GUIs. This allows for the construction of unique purpose built nodes that can work in both the Fusion and Edit pages. 

There is an introductory "Macro Building Essentials" thread on the Steakunderwater forum that helps artists create their own macros in only a short period of time.

![][image135]

Building GUIs With Fusion's UI Manager
Resolve/Fusion supports the use of a native Lua and Python based GUI building system called the UI Manager library. This library is used whenever you need to create your own custom graphical user interface in a Fusion based Lua or Python script. 

The UI Manager allows you to add object oriented windows, buttons, text fields, sliders, tree list views, and controls that are accessible inside your script code. The UI Manager library is QT window manager based, and it is designed to replace Fusion 7's older IUP and AskUser dialog approaches when creating script based GUIs.

Available GUI Elements
As you start to construct new user interfaces in Resolve/Fusion, you can add the following GUI elements by placing them inside the window's ui:VGroup{} tag:

* ui:VGroup{}
* ui:HGroup{}
* ui:Stack{}
* ui:VGap{}
* ui:HGap{}
* ui:Button{}
* ui:CheckBox{}
* ui:ColorPicker{}
* ui:ComboBox{}
* ui:DoubleSpinBox{}
* ui:Label{}
* ui:LineEdit{}
* ui:Slider{}
* ui:SpinBox{}
* ui:TabBar{}
* ui:TextEdit{}
* ui:Tree{}

What is an ID Tag?

In the UI Manager an important concept to understand at this point is that an ID tag string is placed inside the { } curly braces on every control in the GUI layout. 

The ID tag setting could be just a single letter in quotes or it could be a longer text string (written without spaces) that is used to define the name that Lua uses to access that specific GUI element from code. 

ID = 'myCustomName',

ID tags are used to allow the UI Manager to respond uniquely to user interactions with each of the controls in a window such as handling button clicks, sliders, checkboxes, typing text in a textfield, etc...

AddWindow()
The AddWindow() command is used to create a new UI Manager window. This window holds the GUI elements in a user interface.

![][image72]

The following code snippet shows the bare minimum of code you need to add to a Lua script in order to create a new UI Manager based window that has a GUI element inside of it. 

In this piece of sample code a new window is created that has the title "My First Window". The label GUI element is added to the view that displays the textual message "This is a Label". You can close the new view by clicking on the standard window close box.

-- Create a new window
local ui = fu.UIManager
local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
local width,height = 400,200
 
win = disp:AddWindow({
  ID = 'MyWin',
  WindowTitle = 'My First Window',
  Geometry = { 100, 100, width, height },
  Spacing = 10,
 
  ui:VGroup{
    ID = 'root',
   
    -- Add your GUI elements here:
    ui:Label{ ID = 'L', Text = 'This is a Label'},
  },
})
 
-- The window was closed
function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)
    disp:ExitLoop()
end
 
-- Add your GUI element based event functions here:
itm = win:GetItems()
 
win:Show()
disp:RunLoop()
win:Hide()

How do I use the new GUI elements?

ui:VGroup{} / ui:HGroup{}

The ui:VGroup{} and ui:HGroup{} GUI elements are used to create vertical and horizontal layouts inside the window. You can stack multiple of these group objects nested inside of each other to create complex GUIs with UI elements arranged onscreen in rows and columns, or even a grid style of layout is possible.

Lua:
ui:VGroup{
  ID = "root",
  -- Add your GUI elements here:
}.


Python:
ui.VGroup({"ID": "root"},[
	# Add your GUI elements here:
]),

ui:VGap{} / ui:HGap{}

The ui:VGap{} and ui:HGap{} GUI elements are used to provide space between each of the GUI controls so it is easier to navigate inside the window and to create a more logical grouping of the elements inside of a ui:VGroup{} or ui:HGroup{} layout. The gap controls have options that allow you to define the space between controls using either pixels or a relative measurement.

This example adds a 5 pixel wide horizontal gap between the controls that are placed on either side of a ui:HGap element in a ui:VGroup{} or ui:HGroup{} layout:

Lua:
ui:HGap(5),

Python:
ui.HGap(5),

This example creates a flexible sized horizontal between the controls that are placed on either side of a ui:HGap element in a ui:VGroup{} or ui:HGroup{} layout:

Lua:
ui:HGap(0, 1.0),

Python
ui.HGap(0, 1.0),

ui:Button{}
The ui:Button{} control will create a simple rectangular shaped clickable button. 
![][image306]

You can assign a textual label to the new button by adding an attribute like: Text = 'The Button Label'. If your operating system's default font supports showing Emoji's or extended Unicode characters you can add them to the Text label string on a button, too.

If you want to add a button to a UI Manager window layout that is done by writing an entry like this:
ui:Button{ID = "MyButton", Text = "Connect"},

The Text setting for the button is the actual label that is written on the button. You are able to use Unicode based Emoji icons as part of the Text label string if you are looking for an easy way to add a picture to the button.

The ID setting for the button is the internal name that is used to access the button from other functions in your Lua script.

After you have created a new ui:Button entry inside of your window creation code, further down in the Lua script you would add a matching function that responds to events that are triggered when the button is pressed.

Since I have an ID setting of MyButton I would need to create a Lua function like this to handle the button clicking action:
function win.On.MyButton.Clicked(ev)
	print('Hello World!')
end

Inside of the win.On.MyButton.Clicked() function you are free to write in any Lua code you want. 

You can also rename the button's label once it has been clicked by assigning a new text string to the button label .Text attribute. The new string text that you can assign to the button label doesn't have to be a hard quoted object. It could be a string that is sourced at run-time from a dynamic element coming right from the active Fusion comp like the name of the active node selection, the current composite's filename, or it could come from any Lua variable you want to assign.

Changing a button label at runtime using Lua:
function win.On.MyButton.Clicked(ev)
	itm.MyButton.Text = "Link Active"
end

Adding a button using Lua:
local ui = fu.UIManager
local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)

  Geometry = { 100, 100, width, height },
  Spacing = 10,
 
  ui:VGroup{
    ID = 'root',
   
    -- Add your GUI elements here:
    ui:HGroup{
      Margin = 50,
      ui:Button{ID = 'MyButton', Text = 'The Button Label'},
    }
  },
})
 
-- The window was closed

    disp:ExitLoop()
end
 
-- Add your GUI element based event functions here:

function win.On.MyButton.Clicked(ev)
  print('Button Clicked')
    disp:ExitLoop()
end
 
win:Show()
disp:RunLoop()
win:Hide()

Adding a button using Python:
ui = fu.UIManager
disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)

dlg = disp.AddWindow({'WindowTitle': 'My First Window', 'ID': 'MyWin', 'Geometry': [100, 100, 200, 50], 'Spacing': 0,},[
	ui.VGroup({'Spacing': 0,},[
		# Add your GUI elements here:
		ui.HGroup({},[
			# Add four buttons that have an icon resource attached and no border shading
			ui.Button({
				'ID': 'MyButton',
				'Text': 'The Button Label',
			}),
		]),
	]),
])

itm = dlg.GetItems()

# The window was closed
def _func(ev):
	disp.ExitLoop()
dlg.On.MyWin.Close = _func

# Add your GUI element based event functions here:
def _func(ev):
	print('Button Clicked')
	disp.ExitLoop()
dlg.On.MyButton.Clicked = _func

dlg.Show()
disp.RunLoop()
dlg.Hide()

ui:CheckBox{}
The ui:CheckBox{} control will add a checkbox to the window layout. This control is used to define a boolean value which represents either a true (1) or false (0) logical state that corresponds visually to a checked or unchecked status for the control.

![][image290]

You can assign a label to the new checkBox by adding an attribute like: 
Text = 'The Checkbox Label'.

Adding a Checkbox using Lua:
local ui = fu.UIManager
local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
local width,height = 400,200
 
win = disp:AddWindow({
  ID = 'MyWin',
  WindowTitle = 'My First Window',

  ui:VGroup{
    ID = 'root',
    Margin = 50,
   
    -- Add your GUI elements here:
    ui:CheckBox{ID = 'MyCheckbox', Text = 'The Checkbox Label'},
  },
})
 
-- The window was closed
function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)
    disp:ExitLoop()
end
 
-- Add your GUI element based event functions here:

function win.On.MyCheckbox.Clicked(ev)
  print('[Checkbox] ' .. tostring(itm.MyCheckbox.Checked))
end
 
win:Show()
disp:RunLoop()

dlg = disp.AddWindow({"WindowTitle": "My First Window", "ID": "MyWin", "Geometry": [100, 100, 400, 200],},[
	ui.VGroup({"Spacing": 0,},[
		# Add your GUI elements here:
		ui.CheckBox({"ID": "MyCheckbox", "Text": "The Checkbox Label"}),
	]),
])

itm = dlg.GetItems()

# The window was closed
def _func(ev):
	disp.ExitLoop()
dlg.On.MyWin.Close = _func

# Add your GUI element based event functions here:

def _func(ev):
	print("[Checkbox] " + str(itm["MyCheckbox"].Checked))
dlg.On.MyCheckbox.Clicked = _func

dlg.Show()
disp.RunLoop()
dlg.Hide()

ui:ColorPicker{}
The ui:ColorPicker{} control provides Red/Green/Blue color sliders and a preview color swatch that can be used to create a custom color value.

![][image81]

You can enter a default color for the ColorPicker using:
ui:ColorPicker{ ID = "Color", Color = { R = 0.753, G = 0.753, B = 0.753, A = 1}},

If you need an alpha channel slider in the ColorPicker then you can use:
ui:ColorPicker{ ID = "Color", Color = { R = 1, G = 1, B = 1, A = 1}, DoAlpha = true  },

You can read the color picker RGB float values using:

red = itm.Color.Color.R
green = itm.Color.Color.G
blue = itm.Color.Color.B

Adding a color picker using Lua:
local ui = fu.UIManager
local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
local width,height = 400,200
 
win = disp:AddWindow({
  ID = 'MyWin',
  WindowTitle = 'My First Window',
  Geometry = {100, 100, width, height},
  Spacing = 10,
 
  ui:VGroup{
    ID = 'root',
   
    -- Add your GUI elements here:
    ui:ColorPicker{ID = 'Color'},
  },
})
 
-- The window was closed
function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)
    disp:ExitLoop()
end
 
-- Add your GUI element based event functions here:
itm = win:GetItems()
 
win:Show()
disp:RunLoop()
win:Hide()

ui:ComboBox{}
The ui:ComboBox{} control allows you to show a ComboControl / Options Menu style of menu that allows you to select an individual menu item from a list of entries. 

![][image330]

You can read the text string for the current ComboBox selection using ".CurrentText" like this:
print(itm.MyCombo.CurrentText)

You can read the index value for the current ComboBox selection using ".CurrentIndex" like this:
print(itm.MyCombo.CurrentIndex)

Note: You need to define the list of menu items outside the AddWindow() function using the AddItem() command.

Adding a ComboBox using Lua:
local ui = fu.UIManager
local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
local width,height = 400,100
 
win = disp:AddWindow({
  ID = 'MyWin',
  WindowTitle = 'My First Window',
  Geometry = {100, 100, width, height},
  Spacing = 10,
 
  ui:VGroup{
    ID = 'root',
   
    -- Add your GUI elements here:
    ui:ComboBox{ID = 'MyCombo', Text = 'Combo Menu'},
  },
})
 
-- The window was closed
function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)
    disp:ExitLoop()
end
 
-- Add your GUI element based event functions here:
itm = win:GetItems()
 
-- Add the items to the ComboBox menu

ui:DoubleSpinBox{}
The ui:DoubleSpinBox{} control allows you to enter numeric values. This GUI element can be incremented by typing a number in directly, pressing the up and down arrow buttons, or by clicking in the number field and then scrolling your mouse scroll wheel.

![][image153]

You will typically want to control the size of the ui:DoubleSpinBox control in the GUI by placing it inside a ui:VGroup{} or ui:HGroup{} element.

Adding a DoubleSpinBox number field using Lua:

local ui = fu.UIManager
local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
local width,height = 400,75
 
win = disp:AddWindow({
  ID = 'MyWin',
  WindowTitle = 'My First Window',
  Geometry = {100, 100, width, height},
  Spacing = 10,
 
  ui:VGroup{
    ID = 'root',
 
    -- Add your GUI elements here:
    ui:DoubleSpinBox{ID='MySpinner'},
  },
})
 
-- The window was closed
function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)
    disp:ExitLoop()
end
 
-- Add your GUI element based event functions here:
itm = win:GetItems()
 
function win.On.MySpinner.ValueChanged(ev)
  print('[DoubleSpinBox Value] '.. itm.MySpinner.Value)
end
 
win:Show()
disp:RunLoop()
win:Hide()

dlg.On.MyWin.Close = _func

# Add your GUI element based event functions here:

def _func(ev):
	print( "[DoubleSpinBox Value] " + str(itm['MySpinner'].Value))
dlg.On.MySpinner.ValueChanged = _func

dlg.Show()
disp.RunLoop()
dlg.Hide()

ui:Label{}
The ui:Label{} control allows you to add a block of non user editable text to the window.

![][image263]

Using several Label elements inside of your different ui:VGroup{} or ui:HGroup{} layouts can help visually break up a larger more complex window layout into smaller more logical groupings. This will make it easier for a user to understand what a set of controls can be used for.

Adding a textual label using Lua:

local ui = fu.UIManager
local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
local width,height = 400,200
 
win = disp:AddWindow({
  ID = 'MyWin',
  WindowTitle = 'My First Window',
  Geometry = {100, 100, width, height},
  Spacing = 10,
 
  ui:VGroup{
    ID = 'root',
 
    -- Add your GUI elements here:
    ui:Label{ID = 'L', Text = 'This is a Label', Alignment = { AlignHCenter = true, AlignTop = true },},
  },
})
 
-- The window was closed
function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)
    disp:ExitLoop()
end
 
-- Add your GUI element based event functions here:
itm = win:GetItems()
 
win:Show()
disp:RunLoop()

dlg = disp.AddWindow({"WindowTitle": "My First Window", "ID": "MyWin", "Geometry": [100, 100, 400, 200],},[
	ui.VGroup({"Spacing": 0,},[
		# Add your GUI elements here:
		ui.Label({"ID": "Label", "Text": "This is a Label",}),
	]),
])

itm = dlg.GetItems()

# The window was closed
def _func(ev):

dlg.On.MyWin.Close = _func

# Add your GUI element based event functions here:

dlg.Show()
disp.RunLoop()

ui:Slider{}
The ui:Slider{} control provides a horizontal slider control.

![][image201]

Add a slider using Lua:
local ui = fu.UIManager
local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
local width,height = 400,100
 
win = disp:AddWindow({
  ID = 'MyWin',
  WindowTitle = 'My First Window',
  Geometry = {100, 100, width, height},
  Spacing = 10,
 
  ui:HGroup{
    ID = 'root',
   
    -- Add your GUI elements here:
    ui:Slider{ID = 'MySlider'},
   
    ui:Label{ID = 'MyLabel', Text = 'Value: ',},
  },
})
 
-- The window was closed
function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)
  disp:ExitLoop()
end
 
-- Add your GUI element based event functions here:
itm = win:GetItems()
 
itm.MySlider.Value = 25
itm.MySlider.Minimum = 0
itm.MySlider.Maximum = 100
 
function win.On.MySlider.ValueChanged(ev)
  itm.MyLabel.Text = 'Slider Value: ' .. tostring(ev.Value)
end
 
win:Show()
disp:RunLoop()
win:Hide()

Add a slider using Python:
ui = fu.UIManager
disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)

dlg = disp.AddWindow({"WindowTitle": "My First Window", "ID": "MyWin", "Geometry": [100, 100, 400, 100],},[
	ui.HGroup({"Spacing": 0,},[
		# Add your GUI elements here:
		ui.Slider({"ID": "MySlider",}),
		ui.Label({"ID": "MyLabel", "Text": "Value:",}),
	]),
])

itm = dlg.GetItems()

# The window was closed
def _func(ev):
	disp.ExitLoop()
dlg.On.MyWin.Close = _func

# Add your GUI element based event functions here:

itm['MySlider'].Value = 25
itm['MySlider'].Minimum = 0
itm['MySlider'].Maximum = 100

def _func(ev):
	itm['MyLabel'].Text = "Slider Value: " + str(ev['Value'])
	print("Slider Value: " + str(ev['Value']))
dlg.On.MySlider.ValueChanged = _func

dlg.Show()
disp.RunLoop()
dlg.Hide()

ui:LineEdit{}
The ui:LineEdit{} control adds a single line based editable text field control.

![][image374]

The "PlaceholderText" attribute lets you define a label text that is shown when the field is empty. This is useful for indicating what the control is meant to be used for.

Add a LineEdit field using Lua:
local ui = fu.UIManager
local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
local width,height = 400,200
 
win = disp:AddWindow({
  ID = 'MyWin',
  WindowTitle = 'My First Window',
  Geometry = { 100, 100, width, height },
  Spacing = 10,
 
  ui:VGroup{
    ID = 'root',
    Margin = 50,
   
    -- Add your GUI elements here:
    ui:LineEdit{ID='MyLineTxt', Text = 'Hello Fusioneers!', PlaceholderText = 'Please Enter a few words.',},
   
    ui:Button{ID = 'PrintButton', Text = 'Print Text'},
  },
})
 
-- The window was closed
function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)
    disp:ExitLoop()
end
 
-- Add your GUI element based event functions here:
itm = win:GetItems()
 
function win.On.PrintButton.Clicked(ev)
  print(itm.MyLineTxt.Text)
end
 
function win.On.MyLineTxt.TextChanged(ev)
    print(itm.MyLineTxt.Text)
end
 
win:Show()
disp:RunLoop()
win:Hide()

ui = fu.UIManager
disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)

dlg = disp.AddWindow({"WindowTitle": "My First Window", "ID": "MyWin", "Geometry": [100, 100, 400, 125],},[
	ui.VGroup({"Spacing": 10,},[
		# Add your GUI elements here:
		ui.LineEdit({"ID": "MyLineTxt", "Text": "Hello Fusioneers!", "PlaceholderText": "Please Enter a few words.", "Weight": 0.5}),
		ui.Button({"ID": "PrintButton", "Text": "Print Text", "Weight": 0.5}),
	]),
])

itm = dlg.GetItems()

# The window was closed
def _func(ev):
	disp.ExitLoop()
dlg.On.MyWin.Close = _func

# Add your GUI element based event functions here:

def _func(ev):
	print(itm['MyLineTxt'].Text)
dlg.On.PrintButton.Clicked = _func

def _func(ev):
	print(itm['MyLineTxt'].Text)
dlg.On.MyLineTxt.TextChanged = _func

dlg.Show()
disp.RunLoop()
dlg.Hide()

ui:TextEdit{}
The ui:TextEdit{} control adds an editable text field. It is possible to render the text field contents using either unformatted plaintext or HTML.

![][image271]

A ui:TextEdit field's contents can be made read-only (and non-editable) by adding a "ReadOnly" tag like this:
ui:TextEdit{ID='Txt', Text = 'Hello', ReadOnly = true,}

You can change the contents of a ui:TextEdit field using either:
-- Plain unformatted text:
itm.MyTxt.PlainText = 'Hello Fusioneers'

-- HTML encoded text:
itm.MyTxt.HTML = [[<h1>HTML Formatted Text</h1><p>This this HTML rendered in a ui:TextEdit field!</p>]]

The "PlaceholderText" attribute lets you define a label text that is shown when the field is empty. This is useful for indicating what the control is meant to be used for.

Add a TextEdit field using Lua:
local ui = fu.UIManager
local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
local width,height = 600,800
 
win = disp:AddWindow({
  ID = 'MyWin',
  WindowTitle = 'My First Window',
  Geometry = { 100, 100, width, height },
  Spacing = 10,
 
  ui:VGroup{
    ID = 'root',
    Margin = 50,
   
    -- Add your GUI elements here:
    ui:TextEdit{ID='MyTxt', Text = 'Hello', PlaceholderText = 'Please Enter a few words.',}
  },
})
 
-- The window was closed
function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)
    disp:ExitLoop()
end
 
-- Add your GUI element based event functions here:
itm = win:GetItems()
 
function win.On.MyTxt.TextChanged(ev)
    print(itm.MyTxt.PlainText)
end
 
win:Show()
disp:RunLoop()
win:Hide()

Add a TextEdit field using Python:
ui = fu.UIManager
disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)

dlg = disp.AddWindow({ "WindowTitle": "My First Window", "ID": "MyWin", "Geometry": [100, 100, 600, 800], "Spacing": 10, "Margin": 10,},[
	ui.VGroup({ "ID": "root",},[
		# Add your GUI elements here:
		ui.TextEdit({ 
			"ID": "MyTxt",
			"Text": "Hello",
			"PlaceholderText": "Please Enter a few words.",
			"Lexer": "fusion",
		}),
	]),
])

itm = dlg.GetItems()

# The window was closed
def _func(ev):
	disp.ExitLoop()
dlg.On.MyWin.Close = _func

# Add your GUI element based event functions here:

def _func(ev):
	print(itm['MyTxt'].PlainText)
dlg.On.MyTxt.TextChanged = _func

dlg.Show()
disp.RunLoop()
dlg.Hide()

ui:Tree{}
The ui:Tree{} control creates a spreadsheet like grid layout. This is useful for listing elements in a report with rows and columns.

![][image328]

The entries in a ui:Tree can be made clickable and sortable using the following tags:
ui:Tree{ID = 'Tree', SortingEnabled=true, Events = {  ItemDoubleClicked=true, ItemClicked=true }, },

You can detect a single click on a row using "function win.On.Tree.ItemClicked(ev)".

You can detect a double click on a row using "function win.On.Tree.ItemDoubleClicked(ev)".

Inside the single click or double click events you can read the row name text that was clicked with "ev.item.Text[1]". The index value in the [] brackets is the specific column heading text you want to display. 

You can edit the contents of a specific tree view cell that was clicked on using "ev.column" to access an individual cell: 
-- A Tree view cell was clicked on
function win.On.Tree.ItemClicked(ev)
  -- You can use the ev.column value to edit a specific ui:Tree cell label
  ev.item.Text[ev.column] = '*CLICK*'
end

It is possible to add folding disclosure triangle sections to a tree view to have sub-headings. This is a more advanced topic so it will be discussed in a future tutorial.

The width of each heading is adjusted using the ".ColumnWidth" setting:
-- Resize the Columns
itm.Tree.ColumnWidth[0] = 150
itm.Tree.ColumnWidth[1] = 300
itm.Tree.ColumnWidth[2] = 50

When you are dynamically re-building a tree view you can use the "itm.Tree:Clear()" command to clear out the existing items.

Add a tree view using Lua:
local ui = fu.UIManager
local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
local width,height = 430,700
 
win = disp:AddWindow({
  ID = 'MyWin',
  WindowTitle = 'Tree',
  Geometry = { 100, 100, width, height },
  Spacing = 0,
 
  ui:VGroup{
    ID = 'root',
    ui:Tree{ID = 'Tree', SortingEnabled=true, Events = {ItemDoubleClicked=true, ItemClicked=true}, },  
  },
})
 
-- The window was closed
function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)
    disp:ExitLoop()
end
 
-- Add your GUI element based event functions here:
itm = win:GetItems()
 
-- Add a header row.
hdr = itm.Tree:NewItem()
hdr.Text[0] = ''
hdr.Text[1] = 'Column A'
hdr.Text[2] = 'Column B'
hdr.Text[3] = 'Column C'
hdr.Text[4] = 'Column D'
hdr.Text[5] = 'Column E'
itm.Tree:SetHeaderItem(hdr)
 
-- Number of columns in the Tree list
itm.Tree.ColumnCount = 5
 
-- Resize the Columns
itm.Tree.ColumnWidth[0] = 100
itm.Tree.ColumnWidth[1] = 75
itm.Tree.ColumnWidth[2] = 75
itm.Tree.ColumnWidth[3] = 75
itm.Tree.ColumnWidth[4] = 75
itm.Tree.ColumnWidth[5] = 75
 
-- Add an new row entries to the list
for row = 1, 50 do
  itRow = itm.Tree:NewItem();
  -- String.format is used to create a leading zero padded row number like 'Row A01' or 'Row B01'.
  itRow.Text[0] = string.format('Row %02d', row);
  itRow.Text[1] = string.format('A %02d', row);
  itRow.Text[2] = string.format('B %02d', row);
  itRow.Text[3] = string.format('C %02d', row);
  itRow.Text[4] = string.format('D %02d', row);  
  itRow.Text[5] = string.format('E %02d', row);
  itm.Tree:AddTopLevelItem(itRow)
end
 
-- A Tree view row was clicked on
function win.On.Tree.ItemClicked(ev)
  print('[Single Clicked] ' .. tostring(ev.item.Text[0]))
 
  -- You can use the ev.column value to edit a specific ui:Tree cell label
  ev.item.Text[ev.column] = '*CLICK*'
end
 
-- A Tree view row was double clicked on
function win.On.Tree.ItemDoubleClicked(ev)
  print('[Double Clicked] ' .. tostring(ev.item.Text[0]))

AddConfig
AddConfig() is a function that is often used to capture window closing hotkeys events. 

This approach stops Fusion from closing your foreground composite document each time a user presses Escape, Control+W/Command+W, or Control+F4/Command+F4 when the user expects the hotkey will be used to actually close a UI Manager GUI window instead.

AddConfig using Lua:
-- Check the current operating system platform
local platform = (FuPLATFORM_WINDOWS and 'Windows') or (FuPLATFORM_MAC and 'Mac') or (FuPLATFORM_LINUX and 'Linux')

-- Create the appropriate hotkey message if you are on Windows/Linux or Mac
local hotkeyTextMessage = 'Press (Control + W) or (Control + F4) to close this window.'
if platform == 'Mac' then
	hotkeyTextMessage = 'Press (Command + W) or (Command + F4) to close this window.'
end
